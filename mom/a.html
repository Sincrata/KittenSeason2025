  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon filled the air as ${PregnantName} sat in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} favorite diner booth. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)}’d been dating around and looking for a serious partner for years, but nothing seemed to really stick. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} getting tired of waiting for the perfect floss to find ${PregnantHerHimThem}. Today, however, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} usual lonely breakfast took an unexpected turn when a tiny, curious face peeked over the top of the booth directly opposite ${PregnantHerHimThem}.

It was a toddler, perhaps two years old, with eyes wide and sparkling, clumsily trying to spoon scrambled eggs into their mouth. ${PregnantName} chuckled, unable to wipe the smile from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face. 


*Oh, look at that little one*, ${PregnantName} thought, a soft smile spreading across ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face. *So tiny and full of mischief.*

${PregnantName} chuckled, watching the kitten’s antics. It reminded ${PregnantHerHimThem} of that time ${PregnantHerHisTheir} cousin's kit tried to put the remote in the fridge. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} adored kittens, and really thought that ${PregnantSheHeThey} would have one of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} own at this point in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} life.

A comfortable silence settled in, as ${PregnantSheHeThey} imagined a kitten of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} very own sitting across from ${PregnantHerHimThem} in the booth. Then, ${PregnantName} realized that in that perfect fantasy, a partner was not present. It was just ${PregnantHerHimThem} and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} precious kitten together against the world.

${PregnantName} sighed and took a drink of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} coffee. *It’s just a dream,* ${PregnantSheHeThey} thought. *But does it have to be?*

 ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} wanted it, didn't ${PregnantSheHeThey}? To be a parent? Yeah, ${PregnantName} thinks ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantDoesDo}. More than ${PregnantSheHeThey} realized, maybe. ${PregnantName} looked down at ${PregnantHerHisTheir} drink slowly, a mix of excitement and apprehension flickering in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart. 
 

${PregnantSheHeThey} glanced back up at the toddler across from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} booth. *Then why don’t I go for it! If I want it, why wait? Who’s to say that I will ever find a partner to start a family with!? Why should I have to have one to be a parent?!*

But the pragmatic half of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mind felt a rush of all the 'what-ifs' that could possibly stand in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} way. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} squeezed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mug, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} brow furrowed. *Wait,* ${PregnantSheHeThey} told ${PregnantHerHimThem}self. *Hold on a second. It's not that simple, ${PregnantName}. There’s a whole process – finding a sperm donor, getting inseminated, all the legalities, the expenses. It's a massive commitment.* ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} paused, taking a breath. *What if I lose my job? What if something happens to me? What if I can’t handle pregnancy on my own? What if I’m not a good parent? This wouldn't be just about me anymore; it would be about a whole new life.* ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} started to feel hopeless, the weight of such a monumental decision pressing down on ${PregnantHerHimThem}.

 ${PregnantSheHeThey} finished ${PregnantHerHisTheir} cup of coffee and continued to sit and brew on this idea. This strong feeling in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} chest grew stronger by the minute. *Yes, there are a million ‘what-ifs’ that could pop up, for anything in life, really. But what I know for sure is that I want a kitten. One way or another. And all the other ways have left me heartbroken and lonely. I can’t keep waiting for a miracle. I can’t let fear of the unknown get in the way of my dreams. I have so much love to give.*`.trim();

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 3 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.
  // 1: fill in the "Option X" after the "label:" This will be what displays on the options buttons
  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"
  // 3: fill in the lowercase letter of the prompt the option leads to. Letters can be found on the image Ten made.

      response: ` A quiet moment passed, the clatter of plates and distant chatter fading into the background. ${PregnantName} closed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hands into determined fists, feeling not just unwavering love for ${PregnantHerHisTheir} nonexistent kittenfloss, but also boundless faith in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} possible future. The practical concerns didn't vanish entirely, but they suddenly felt manageable, surmountable. 

A genuine smile, one of relief and profound happiness, spread across ${PregnantName}'s face. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} got up from the table, and paid ${PregnantHerHisTheir} ticket on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} way out. *This is it!* ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} declared in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart. *I’m going to do it. I’m going to become a parent.* And just like that, stepping out of the diner and into the sunshine, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} biggest adventure yet began.`,

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Nervous",
      response: ` Despite ${PregnantName}’s bought of optimism, ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere}n't entirely convinced. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} squeezed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hands together as ${PregnantSheHeThey} drowned in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} thoughts. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} not sure ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} ready for something so huge. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantDoesDo}n't want to rush into anything if ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantDoesDo}n't feel confident. 

${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} went home, and over the next few days, the idea of parenthood kept resurfacing in ${PregnantName}'s mind. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)}'d find ${PregnantHerHimThem}self randomly thinking about it, asking ${PregnantHerHimThem}self hypothetical questions, or just staring off into space, imagining how things could be. 

${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} started doing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} research, poring over articles about donor processes, adoption, and single parenting. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} even talked to friends who were parents, and cautiously, to family members, gauging their thoughts and experiences. 

Finally, after two long weeks of mulling it over, the thought of having a kittenfloss on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} own simply wouldn't leave ${PregnantName}’s head. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} had considered every potential challenge, every hurdle, and every 'what if.' And yet, ${PregnantSheHeThey} couldn't find a strong enough reason *not* to do it.

One evening, as things were winding down for the night, ${PregnantName} made the decision, a newfound certainty in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} sat up with a start and pulled ${PregnantHerHisTheir} laptop over to reply to an email to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} physician. *I'm ready.* ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} typed without a shred of hesitation. *I'm ready for the insemination. What appointment dates are available this month?*

${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} overwhelmed with happiness, feeling like ${PregnantHerHisTheir} comfortable rhythm was about to gain the most beautiful, exciting new beat. The future, once a collection of 'what ifs,' now felt wonderfully, thrillingly real.`,
