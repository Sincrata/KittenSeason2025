  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon filled the air as ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} sat across from each other in their favorite diner booth. They’d been together for years, their relationship a comforting blend of easy laughter and shared silences. Today, however, their usual breakfast chatter took an unexpected turn when a tiny, curious face peeked over the top of the booth directly opposite them.
It was a toddler, perhaps two years old, with eyes wide and sparkling, clumsily trying to spoon scrambled eggs into their mouth. ${OtherName} chuckled, nudging ${PregnantName}. 

"Oh, look at that little one," ${PregnantName} cooed, a soft smile spreading across ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face. "So tiny and full of mischief."
${OtherName} chuckled, watching the kitten’s antics. "Totally adorable. Reminds me of that time your cousin's kit tried to put the remote in the fridge."
A comfortable silence settled between them, filled with the warmth of shared memories and the quiet hum of the diner. Then, ${PregnantName}, still gazing across, spoke in a voice barely above a whisper. "You know, sometimes, I really think about it. About having a little one ourselves."
${OtherName} looked at ${PregnantHerHimThem}, surprised, then a thoughtful expression crossed ${OtherHerHisTheir} face. "Funny you say that. I've been thinking about it too."
“We both want it, don’t we? To be parents?” ${OtherName} nodded slowly, a mix of excitement and apprehension flickering in ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes. “Yeah, I think I do. More than I realized, maybe.” ${PregnantName} reached across the table, taking ${OtherName}’s hands. “Then let’s go for it! If we both feel it, why wait?”
But ${OtherName}, the pragmatic half of their duo, felt a rush of all the 'what-ifs' that could possibly stand in their way. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} squeezed ${PregnantName}’s hands, ${OtherHerHisTheir} brow furrowed. “Wait, hold on a second. It's not that simple, ${PregnantName}. We’d have to go through the whole process – finding a donor mother, all the legalities, the expenses. It's a massive commitment.” ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} paused, taking a breath. “What if we lose our jobs? What if something happens to one of us? What if we’re not good parents? This isn't just about us anymore; it would be about a whole new life.” ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} voice ${OtherWasWere} laced with genuine concern, the weight of such a monumental decision pressing down on ${OtherHerHimThem}.
${PregnantName} listened patiently, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} gaze unwavering, full of love. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} then gently stroked ${OtherName}’s knuckles. “${OtherName}, my love, you’re right, it’s not simple. And yes, there are a million ‘what-ifs’ that could pop up, for anything in life, really. But what I know for sure is that I love you, and no matter what happens, we’ll face it together. We’ve always been a team. We can’t let fear of the unknown get in the way of our dreams.” ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} leaned forward, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} eyes earnest and bright. “We’ll learn, we’ll adapt, and we’ll be amazing parents because we’ll have each other, and we’ll have so much love to give.”

 
Question 
How does ${OtherName} respond? Happy or Nervous?

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 3 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.
  // 1: fill in the "Option X" after the "label:" This will be what displays on the options buttons
  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"
  // 3: fill in the lowercase letter of the prompt the option leads to. Letters can be found on the image Ten made.
  const options = {
    "option1": {
      label: "Happy",
      response: ` A quiet moment passed, the clatter of plates and distant chatter fading into the background. ${OtherName} looked into ${PregnantName}’s eyes, seeing not just unwavering love, but also boundless faith in their future. The practical concerns didn't vanish entirely, but they suddenly felt manageable, surmountable. A genuine smile, one of relief and profound happiness, spread across ${OtherName}'s face. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} leaned over the table, giving ${PregnantName} a soft, lingering kiss. “You’re right,” ${OtherSheHeThey} whispered, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice thick with emotion. “You’re absolutely right. Let’s do it. Let’s become parents.” And just like that, amidst the comforting hum of the diner, their biggest adventure yet began.

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Nervous",
      response: ` Despite ${PregnantName}’s loving reassurance, ${OtherName} wasn't entirely convinced. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} squeezed ${PregnantName}'s hands gently. "I know, I know. But I'm just… I'm not sure we're ready for something so huge." ${PregnantName}, understanding ${OtherName}'s hesitation, didn't push. "Okay," ${PregnantSheHeThey} said softly, "You don't have to rush into anything if you don't feel confident. We'll figure it out."
They went home, and over the next few days, the idea of parenthood kept resurfacing in ${OtherName}'s mind. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)}'d find ${OtherHerHimThem}self bringing it up, asking ${PregnantName} hypothetical questions, or just staring off into space, clearly deep in thought. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} started doing ${OtherHerHisTheir} research, poring over articles about donor processes, adoption, and queer parenting. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} even talked to friends who were parents, and cautiously, to family members, gauging their thoughts and experiences. ${PregnantName} found it incredibly sweet, watching ${OtherName} put so much genuine thought into something that had once seemed just a distant dream. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} resisted the urge to nudge or persuade, letting ${OtherName} navigate ${OtherHerHisTheir} own path.
Finally, after two long weeks of mulling it over, the thought of having a child with ${PregnantName} simply wouldn't leave ${OtherName}’s head. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} had considered every potential challenge, every hurdle, and every 'what if.' And yet, ${OtherSheHeThey} couldn't find a strong enough reason not to do it.
One evening, as they were winding down for the night, ${OtherName} turned to ${PregnantName}, a newfound certainty in ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes. "${PregnantName}," ${OtherSheHeThey} began, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice soft but firm, "I've been thinking, and researching, and honestly, I can't find a single good reason why we shouldn't. I'm ready. I'm ready to have a child with you.
${PregnantName}'s face lit up, a joyous laugh bubbling from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} chest as ${PregnantSheHeThey} pulled ${OtherName} into a tight hug. "Oh, ${OtherName}! Really?" ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} overwhelmed with happiness, feeling like their comfortable rhythm was about to gain the most beautiful, exciting new beat. The future, once a collection of 'what ifs,' now felt wonderfully, thrillingly real.
