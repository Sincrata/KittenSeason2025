  const storyText = `The nursery was painted a calming shade of green, tiny outfits were folded neatly in drawers, and the hospital bag, packed with meticulous care, stood ready by the door. ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName}, a couple brimming with excited anticipation, were just days away from the due date. Photos and updates from their surrogate were coming in on the regular. Now well into her third trimester, she carried their precious cargo with an impressive grace that belied her considerable size. ${PregnantName} had arranged ${PregnantHerHisTheir} family leave to begin several days prior, ensuring ${PregnantSheHeThey}'d be there the very second their surrogate gave them the fateful call. ${OtherName}, on the other hand, had missed ${OtherHerHisTheir} chance to claim the leave early and instead had it scheduled at the end of the week. As life often does, it had a flair for the dramatic, and one particular evening decided to rewrite their carefully orchestrated timeline.
That evening found ${PregnantName} alone putting away clean dishes. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} stretched, grunting softly, to reach a top shelf, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} fingers reaching to place a clean coffee cup. Just as ${PregnantSheHeThey} managed it, a sudden ringtone rang out from the phone across the room and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart skipped a beat. It was the distinct ringtone set aside for their surrogate. The world spun for a moment, as ${PregnantSheHeThey} raced across the kitchen and fumbled with the phone before picking it up. When it finally connected, ${PregnantSheHeThey} heard their surrogate trembling and breathless, as she said through pained pauses, “It’s time!” ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} quickly told the surrogate to stay where she is and said ${PregnantSheHeThey} would be there as soon as ${PregnantSheHeThey} can. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} fingers, fumbling with a sudden tremor, as ${PregnantSheHeThey} started to call ${OtherName} while simultaneously slipping ${PregnantHerHisTheir} shoes on and grabbing their keys.
Miles away, in the hushed, late-evening world of ${OtherHerHisTheir} office, ${OtherName}'s phone hummed a silent, desperate symphony on ${OtherHerHisTheir} desk. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} oblivious. A critical, last-minute review had spirited ${OtherHerHimThem} away to a separate conference room. ${PregnantName} called, an insistent series of vibrations that went unnoticed. One, two, three, then a fourth attempt, each buzz a silent plea, swallowed by the focused intensity of the discussion. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} phone, discreetly set to vibrate mode to avoid disturbing ${OtherHerHisTheir} colleagues, kept ${PregnantName}’s growing distress entirely to itself.
${PregnantName} arrived at the surrogate’s house and helped her out to the car as she squeezed tightly on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand and waddled slowly. On the way to the hospital ${PregnantName} tried to call ${OtherName} again but the ringing stretched, punctuated only by the surrogate’s increasingly ragged breaths and the distant echo of a fresh contraction building. Four missed calls to ${OtherName}. A cold, sharp tendril of panic snaked its way around ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart. Why ${OtherWasWere}n't ${OtherSheHeThey} answering? Had something happened to ${OtherHerHimThem}? The fear for their imminent arrival mingled with a terrifying worry for ${PregnantHerHisTheir} partner. Alone with the surrogate and increasingly overwhelmed, ${PregnantSheHeThey} fought back tears, terrified, and utterly unable to reach the one person ${PregnantSheHeThey} needed most.
As the critical work meeting finally wound down, ${OtherName} stretched, eager to be home. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} reached for ${OtherHerHisTheir} phone, only for ${OtherHerHisTheir} heart to sink slightly as ${OtherSheHeThey} saw the stubbornly black screen. Battery dead. A minor annoyance, easily rectified once ${OtherSheHeThey} got in ${OtherHerHisTheir} car, ${OtherSheHeThey} thought. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} began gathering ${OtherHerHisTheir} belongings, ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind already drifting to ${PregnantName} and the quiet comfort of their apartment. But just as ${OtherSheHeThey} shrugged on ${OtherHerHisTheir} jacket, a frazzled colleague approached ${OtherHerHimThem}. “${OtherName}, you’re an expert in this, could you just quickly help me with this one thing?” ${OtherName}, always willing to lend a hand, agreed. What seemed like a 'quick fix' morphed into a complex problem. Time, that mischievous thief, accelerated, an hour slipping by unnoticed as ${OtherName} became entirely engrossed in troubleshooting a critical system issue with ${OtherHerHisTheir} coworker.
It wasn't until ${OtherSheHeThey} finally settled into ${OtherHerHisTheir} car, the engine purring to life, and plugged ${OtherHerHisTheir} phone into the charging port that the digital dam broke. Message after message flooded ${OtherHerHisTheir} screen, each notification a sharp jolt to ${OtherHerHisTheir} system. Missed calls from ${PregnantName}, then a volley of terse, urgent texts from ${PregnantHerHimThem} – words like 'labor,' 'hospital,' 'where are you?!' flashing before ${OtherHerHisTheir} disbelieving eyes. A profound, icy dread seeped into ${OtherHerHisTheir} bones. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} heart hammered against ${OtherHerHisTheir} ribs as ${OtherSheHeThey} immediately called ${PregnantName}, the ringing tone a frantic drumbeat in ${OtherHerHisTheir} ears. ${PregnantName} answered, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice a furious torrent of panic and worry, "Where are you!? What happened?! Are you okay?!" And then, mid-shouting, the phone died again, the battery apparently delivering its last, cruel gasp. Reality slammed into ${OtherName} like a physical blow. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} going to miss it. They were at the hospital. Without a second thought, ${OtherSheHeThey} swerved, making a swift, decisive lane change, and pressed the accelerator. Every fiber of ${OtherHerHisTheir} being screamed one thing: ${OtherSheHeThey} would not miss this. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} could not miss the birth of their precious child.
${OtherName} burst through the hospital doors, a whirlwind of adrenaline, apologies, and sheer desperate hope. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} found ${PregnantName}, surprisingly, calm. Their surrogate mother was propped up in bed, sipping contentedly on a juice box, hooked up to a few monitors but clearly not in immediate distress. The monumental wave of relief that washed over ${OtherHerHimThem} was almost incapacitating, threatening to buckle ${OtherHerHisTheir} knees. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} could have never forgiven ${OtherHerHimThem}self, not in a million years, if ${OtherSheHeThey} had missed the profound moment of their child’s arrival because of a dead phone and a lingering work task. ${PregnantName} gathered ${OtherName} up in a bear hug and after hearing why ${OtherSheHeThey} hadn’t answered the phone, launched into a lecture of “How could you!” and “I was terrified!” and “You knew this could happen!” ${OtherName} took it all, nodding, apologizing profusely, ${OtherHerHisTheir} relief too immense to feel anything but gratitude. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} just so overwhelmingly thankful to be there, by ${PregnantName}’s side now.
Several more hours crawled by, a lengthy but ultimately triumphant labor unfolded. And through every contraction, every breathless push, ${OtherName} was unwavering, a steadfast anchor. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} held ${PregnantName}’s hand, whispered words of excitement and love. When their precious kitten finally entered the world, crying its first mighty cry, ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} were together, hand in hand, their eyes locked on the tiny, new life before them. It had been a chaotic, nerve-wracking journey, filled with unexpected twists and agonizing moments of doubt. But as they looked at their child, perfect and miraculous, clasped together in that sacred moment, it was clear: every second of the struggle had been worth it. They were a family, complete, and the most beautiful chapter of their lives had just begun.
