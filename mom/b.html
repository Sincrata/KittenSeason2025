  const storyText = `${PregnantName} is going to be a parent! The first trimester was supposed to be a time of quiet excitement, but for ${PregnantName}, it was quickly turning into a whirlwind of information. Every free moment found ${PregnantHerHimThem} scrolling through pregnancy blogs or tuning into a new prenatal health podcast. 

Soon, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} newfound knowledge morphed into a strict regimen. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} meals became meticulously planned, down to the exact percentage of fat. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} sleep schedule was calculated to the minute, making spontaneous movie nights a thing of the past. "Did you know," ${PregnantSheHeThey}'d often begin while chatting with friends, "that eating organic kale at precisely 7 PM can boost XYZ?" These increasingly specific, self-inflicted rules were creating an air of constant stress.

 ${PregnantName} started to question everything, slowly eliminating ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hobbies and canceling plans with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} friends just in case they didn't fit perfectly with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} carefully laid plan. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} had a deep desire to be a good parent, but the constant worry and these neurotic behaviors were starting to cast a long shadow over ${PregnantHerHisTheir} life. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} tried to be patient, to calm down, but it was getting harder.

${PregnantName} was so absorbed by the internet’s bombardment of increasingly intricate advice that ${PregnantHerHisTheir} life had become an endless parade of health mandates and dietary restrictions. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} anxiety began to take hold of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} every thought! ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} on the verge of snapping, unsure how much more ${PregnantSheHeThey} could take of the stress!

One particularly demanding morning, the carefully constructed facade finally cracked. As ${PregnantSheHeThey} reached for a brand-new, expensive canister of prenatal protein powder – yet another supplement recommended by an online guru – it slipped from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} grasp, erupting in a cloud of fine, white dust that settled over ${PregnantHerHisTheir} kitchen floor like fresh snow. ${PregnantName} stood there, covered in the costly powder, staring at the wasteful mess, and something inside ${PregnantHerHimThem} simply snapped. Tears, hot and heavy, welled up and streamed down ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face.

Sinking to the floor amidst the powdery disaster, ${PregnantSheHeThey} let out a raw, guttural sob. "This is too hard," ${PregnantSheHeThey} whispered to the empty room, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice barely audible. "I can't do this. I've made a terrible mistake. I'm not fit to be a parent." ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} cried for what felt like an eternity, the weight of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} perceived failures crushing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} spirit. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} alone, covered in protein powder, feeling utterly defeated.

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 3 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.
  // 1: fill in the "Option X" after the "label:" This will be what displays on the options buttons
  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"
  // 3: fill in the lowercase letter of the prompt the option leads to. Letters can be found on the image Ten made.
  const options = {
    "option1": {
      label: "Push through",
      response: `${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} cried for what felt like an eternity, the weight of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} fears crushing ${PregnantHerHimThem}. But amidst the heartache and the mess, a tiny spark ignited. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} kitten. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} kitten was already growing inside ${PregnantHerHimThem}, depending on ${PregnantHerHimThem}. This little life, forming day by day, couldn't wait for ${PregnantHerHimThem} to be perfect; it needed ${PregnantHerHimThem} to be resilient. A fierce wave of protective love washed over ${PregnantHerHimThem}, pushing aside the self-doubt. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} *had* to do this. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} *would* do this. This wasn't about flawless execution; it was about unwavering commitment.

With a deep, shaky breath, ${PregnantName} forced ${PregnantHerHimThem}self up. There was a mess to clean, and a new protein powder order to place. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} put on a familiar, calming podcast, not for more advice, but for a steady voice to help ${PregnantHerHisTheir} focus. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} fears were still there, gnawing at the edges, but ${PregnantSheHeThey} chose to push them down, not ignore, but simply acknowledge and move past. This was the life ${PregnantSheHeThey} had chosen as a single parent, and it was ${PregnantHerHisTheir} responsibility to face its challenges head-on. Things would be hard, incredibly hard, but ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} stronger than ${PregnantSheHeThey} knew, and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} kitten deserved every ounce of that strength.

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Give Up",
      response: `
But then, slowly, as the last of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} tears subsided, a quiet, profound clarity began to settle over ${PregnantHerHimThem}. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} lay there, breathing deeply, and a new thought emerged, clear and resolute: ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} *could do this. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} had to do this.* ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} kitten, tiny and utterly dependent, was already growing inside ${PregnantHerHimThem}, relying on ${PregnantHerHimThem} to get ${PregnantHerHimThem}self together. This little miracle needed a parent who was present, not one consumed by anxiety and impossible standards.

The answer, ${PregnantSheHeThey} realized, wasn't hidden in a complex podcast or a conflicting online forum. It was simple, loving, and right in front of ${PregnantHerHimThem}. With renewed resolve, ${PregnantSheHeThey} pushed ${PregnantHerHimThem}self up, leaving the protein powder for later. Instead of turning back to the glowing screen, ${PregnantName} picked up ${PregnantHerHisTheir} phone, and with a deep breath, called the one person whose advice ${PregnantSheHeThey} knew ${PregnantSheHeThey} could always trust: ${PregnantHerHisTheir} own mother. A new, calmer chapter of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} pregnancy was about to begin.

    ,"option3": {
      label: "Seek Help",
      response: ` After washing off and crying ${PregnantHerHimThem}self to sleep, ${PregnantName} fell into a deep depression that worried ${PregnantHerHisTheir} friends and family.

Eventually, a friend took ${PregnantName} to see a therapist, insisting that professional help was needed. Reluctantly, ${PregnantName} agreed and soon discovered that the therapist was exactly what ${PregnantSheHeThey} needed. The therapist provided ${PregnantHerHimThem} with real, professional advice, answered ${PregnantHerHisTheir} questions about pregnancy, and helped ${PregnantHerHimThem} come up with a plan to ensure the best life for ${PregnantHerHisTheir} kitten while also taking care of ${PregnantHerHimThem}self.

With the therapist's guidance, ${PregnantName} learned to navigate ${PregnantHerHisTheir} feelings and manage ${PregnantHerHisTheir} stress during this difficult time. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} discovered that it was possible to balance the needs of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} growing kitten with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} own needs for security and breathing room. The therapist also reassured ${PregnantName} that it was okay to seek help when needed, and that ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere}n't alone in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} struggles.

Feeling grateful to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} friend and the therapist, ${PregnantName} continued to work on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mental health and pregnancy journey. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} found solace in knowing that ${PregnantSheHeThey} had a trusty therapist ${PregnantSheHeThey} could call upon if ${PregnantSheHeThey} needed more support in the future.
