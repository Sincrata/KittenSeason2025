  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `For months, the world of ${PregnantName} had revolved around one glorious, life-changing event: the arrival of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} little one. Every nursery rhyme sung, every tiny onesie folded, every childbirth class attended felt like a step closer to a perfectly orchestrated welcome. ${PregnantName}, now well into ${PregnantHerHisTheir} third trimester, carried ${PregnantHerHisTheir} precious cargo with an impressive grace that belied ${PregnantHerHisTheir} considerable size. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} heavy, yes, but also radiating with the unique glow of impending parenthood. ${PregnantName} had meticulously prepared for every scenario, or so ${PregnantSheHeThey} thought. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere}, in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} minds, totally ready.

${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} excitement was palpable, a rising anticipation bubbling up through late-night baby name debates and joyful nursery decorating sessions. 

${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} had spent countless hours deciding on everything from feeding schedules to first words, convinced ${PregnantSheHeThey} had every base covered. The hospital bag had been packed and repacked, a symbol of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} readiness, sitting patiently by the door. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} a textbook example of a prepared parent-to-be, brimming with confidence that when the moment came, ${PregnantSheHeThey} would handle it with calm competence.

Then, at 2:37 AM, the universe decided to test ${PregnantHerHisTheir} theory.

${PregnantName} awoke with a sudden, sharp cry that tore through the peaceful quiet of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} bedroom. It wasn't a groan or a whimper; it was an undeniable, pain-filled gasp that instantly jolted ${PregnantName} awake. "AAAAGH!" ${PregnantSheHeThey} cried out, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice laced with surprise and a touch of fear. "It's… it's go time!"

In that instant, every neatly filed piece of information in ${PregnantName}'s brain evaporated. The calm, collected plan ${PregnantSheHeThey} rehearsed a thousand times vanished into thin air, replaced by a deafening silence. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} mind, usually a well-oiled machine, went completely blank. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} stared up at the ceiling fan trying to breath through a contraction, illuminated by the soft glow of the digital clock, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face contorted in an expression of pure agony. Panic, cold and swift, began to coil in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} chest.

${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} carefully practiced breathing techniques, the ones ${PregnantSheHeThey}’d mastered during antenatal classes, seemed to scatter like dust in the wind. All ${PregnantSheHeThey} could think of was the excruciating sharpness of the pain, radiating outward from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} core. A wave of unexpected panic washed over ${PregnantHerHimThem}. This wasn't the gentle, manageable discomfort the birthing videos had shown; this was intense, immediate, and utterly overwhelming.

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 3 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.

  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"

      label: "Fully Freak Out",
      response: `The next few minutes dissolved into a chaotic, almost comical, blur. The initial shock didn’t dissipate; it solidified, trapping ${PregnantHerHimThem} in a vortex of frenzied panic. "Where are the bags?!" ${PregnantName} bellowed, tripping over a laundry basket. "The hospital bag! The snacks! My phone!" ${PregnantName} shrieked, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice startlingly loud in the pre-dawn quiet, as ${PregnantSheHeThey} fumbled with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} nightgown. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} contractions were accompanied by shouts, a desperate attempt to cut through the fog of ${PregnantHerHimThem} own alarm and actually accomplish something. It was as if ${PregnantSheHeThey} needed to shout just to keep moving, to break the spell of paralysis that threatened to consume ${PregnantHerHimThem}. The perfectly constructed facade of readiness, built patiently over nine months, crumbled into dust around ${PregnantHerHisTheir} ears.

In ${PregnantHerHisTheir} haste, every movement seemed designed to go wrong. ${PregnantName} stumbled out of the bedroom, one foot bare, the other sporting a single slipper. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} snatched car keys from the hook, only to discover, mere seconds later, they were the keys to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} old, defunct bicycle. ${PregnantName}, managing to pull on a top backwards, finally made it to the doorway, clutching a bag that, upon closer inspection, turned out to be filled with clean laundry instead of essential baby items. Yet, through all the bumbling and shouting, ${PregnantSheHeThey} somehow, miraculously, made it to the car. ${PregnantName} wrestled with the seat belt, grunting with effort, before finally getting it clicked into place. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} face in the rear view was still etched with alarm.

 The short, frantic journey to the car felt like a scene from an action movie, albeit one featuring a very pregnant woman. ${PregnantName} carefully buckled ${PregnantHerHimThem}self in, and started the car. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} put the car in reverse, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart pounding a frantic rhythm against ${PregnantHerHisTheir} ribs. As ${PregnantSheHeThey} pulled out of the driveway and onto the quiet street, a strange thing happened. The harsh, gripping pain that had awakened ${PregnantHerHisTheir}, the pain that had sent ${PregnantHerHimThem} into a dizzying spiral of panic, began to subside. ${PregnantName} took a few deeper breaths, felt ${PregnantHerHisTheir} muscles relax, and surprisingly, the contractions simply… stopped. 

Despite the newfound calm in the car, ${PregnantName} wasn’t taking any chances. “We’re still going,” ${PregnantSheHeThey} declared to the kitten, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} grip on the steering wheel firm. “Better safe than sorry.” The hospital emergency room was quiet at that hour. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} quickly seen by a kind, reassuring doctor, who listened patiently to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} breathless account of the midnight drama. The doctor performed a quick check-up, a gentle smile playing on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} lips. “Well, ${PregnantName},” ${PregnantSheHeThey} announced, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice calm and comforting, “it seems your baby isn’t quite ready to make their grand entrance just yet. It appears you’ve had what we call ‘Braxton Hicks’ contractions, or a ‘false alarm.’ Your body is just having a little practice run for the real thing.”

${PregnantName} looked at the doctor, a wave of profound relief washing over ${PregnantHerHimThem}. It was a relief so potent it felt almost like exhaustion. The adrenaline that had surged through ${PregnantHerHisTheir} veins now dissipated, leaving ${PregnantHerHimThem} feeling wonderfully, utterly deflated. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere}n’t in labor. It wasn't time. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} could go home. As ${PregnantSheHeThey} walked back to the car under the pre-dawn glow, a sense of understanding settled over ${PregnantHerHimThem}. Life, in its infinite wisdom, had decided to give ${PregnantHerHimThem} a test run. A sneak peek into the beautiful chaos that awaited ${PregnantHerHimThem}. All those confident pronouncements about being "totally ready" now seemed… well, a little naive. ${PregnantName} realized that while ${PregnantSheHeThey}'d thought ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} prepared, the sheer, primal shock of the moment had temporarily derailed ${PregnantHerHimThem}. ${PregnantName} learned that even the most well-practiced techniques could vanish under pressure.

      response: `Heroes aren’t born in calm waters; they’re forged in moments of crisis. After what felt like an eternity, but was probably only a few frantic seconds, ${PregnantName}’s primal instincts kicked in. The fog lifted. “Okay, okay, deep breaths, ${PregnantName},” ${PregnantSheHeThey} told ${PregnantHerHimThem}self, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice surprisingly steady despite the tremor in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hands. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} swung out of bed, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} movements precise and purposeful. The pre-packed “go-bag,” which had sat innocently by the door for weeks, was snatched up. Keys jingled as ${PregnantSheHeThey} grabbed them from the hook. “Come baby, slow and steady,” ${PregnantSheHeThey} urged ${PregnantHerHisTheir} feet, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} eyes scanning ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face for any sign of worsening pain. The fear hadn't vanished, but it was now channeled into action.
