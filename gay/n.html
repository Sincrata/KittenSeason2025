  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `For months, the world of ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} had revolved around one glorious, life-changing event: the arrival of their little one. Every nursery rhyme sung, every tiny onesie folded, every childbirth class attended felt like a step closer to a perfectly orchestrated welcome. Photos and updates from their surrogate were coming in on the regular. Now well into her third trimester, she carried their precious cargo with an impressive grace that belied her considerable size. ${OtherName} had meticulously prepared for every scenario, or so ${OtherSheHeThey} thought. They were, in their minds, totally ready.
Their excitement was palpable, a shared secret language of anticipation spoken through late-night kitten name debates and joyful nursery decorating sessions. They’d spent countless hours discussing everything from feeding schedules to first words, convinced they had every base covered. The hospital bag had been packed and repacked, a symbol of their readiness, sitting patiently by the door. They were a textbook example of prepared parents-to-be, brimming with confidence that when the moment came, they would handle it with calm competence.
Then, at 2:37 AM, the universe decided to test their theory.
${PregnantName} awoke to a sudden, blaring ringtone that tore through the peaceful quiet of their bedroom. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} immediately recognized the chime as the one specifically set to their surrogate’s number. It instantly jolted ${OtherName} awake. ${PregnantName} picked up the phone and fumbled it in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hands before picking it up. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} eyes widened at once. "${OtherName}!" ${PregnantSheHeThey} cried out, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice laced with surprise and a touch of fear. "It's… it's time!"
In that instant, every neatly filed piece of information in ${OtherName}'s brain evaporated. The calm, collected plan ${OtherSheHeThey} rehearsed a thousand times vanished into thin air, replaced by a deafening silence. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} mind, usually a well-oiled machine, went completely blank. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} stared at ${PregnantName}, illuminated by the soft glow of the digital clock, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face contorted in an expression of stunned shock ${OtherSheHeThey} never seen before as they listened to the surrogate on the line. Panic, cold and swift, began to coil in ${OtherHerHisTheir} stomach.
${PregnantName}, meanwhile, was grappling with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} own sudden disarray. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} finished the call but even basic speech seemed to scatter like dust in the wind. A wave of unexpected panic washed over ${PregnantHerHimThem}. “What did she say?!” ${OtherName} insisted. “She is in so much pain,” ${PregnantName} was trying to listen but all ${PregnantSheHeThey} retained was the surrogate's quick breathing and groans of pain.
How do they handle this? Get ahold of themselves or Freak out

      response: `Heroes aren’t born in calm waters; they’re forged in moments of crisis. After what felt like an eternity, but was probably only a few frantic seconds, ${OtherName}’s primal instincts kicked in. The fog lifted. “Okay, okay, focus, ${PregnantName},” ${OtherSheHeThey} said, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice surprisingly steady despite the tremor in ${OtherHerHisTheir} hands. The pre-packed “go-bag,” which had sat innocently by the door for weeks, was snatched up. Keys jingled as ${OtherSheHeThey} grabbed them from the hook.

They rushed to the car and drove the short trip to their surrogate’s home. When they arrived they used a spare key she had given them to come in and found her on the floor of her bedroom slowly making her way out. 

“I got you!” ${PregnantName} quickly ran to her side to help her up carefully.

 “Come on, love, slow and steady,” ${PregnantSheHeThey} urged, gently helping her to her feet, ${OtherName}’s eyes scanning the surrogate’s face for any sign of worsening pain. The fear hadn't vanished, but it was now channeled into action.

The short, frantic journey to the car felt like a scene from an action movie, albeit one featuring a very pregnant woman and two slightly dazed parents-to-be. 
${OtherName} carefully helped her into the back seat, buckled her in, and practically leaped into the driver's side as ${PregnantName} got into the back beside her to hold her hand.
 
 ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} put the car in reverse, ${OtherHerHisTheir} heart pounding a frantic rhythm against ${OtherHerHisTheir} ribs. As they pulled out of the driveway and onto the quiet street, a strange thing happened. The harsh, gripping pain that had awakened the surrogate, the pain that had sent them into a dizzying spiral of panic, began to subside. ${PregnantName} took a few deeper breaths along with her, and she felt her muscles relax, and surprisingly, the contractions simply… stopped. “${PregnantName}, ${OtherName},” she said, her voice softer now, tinged with confusion. “I… I feel a lot better. No more pain.”
Despite the newfound calm in the car, ${OtherName} wasn’t taking any chances. “We’re still going,” ${OtherSheHeThey} declared, ${OtherHerHisTheir} grip on the steering wheel firm. “Better safe than sorry,” ${PregnantName} agreed. The hospital emergency room was quiet at that hour. They were quickly seen by a kind, reassuring doctor, who listened patiently to their breathless account of the midnight drama. The doctor performed a quick check-up, a gentle smile playing on her lips. “Well, dear,” she announced, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice calm and comforting, “it seems your kitten isn’t quite ready to make their grand entrance just yet. It appears you’ve had what we call ‘Braxton Hicks’ contractions, or a ‘false alarm.’ Your body is just having a little practice run for the real thing.”
${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} looked at each other, then back at the doctor, a wave of profound relief washing over them. It was a relief so potent it felt almost like exhaustion. The adrenaline that had surged through their veins now dissipated, leaving them feeling wonderfully, utterly deflated. They weren’t in labor. It wasn't time. They could go home. As they walked back to their car under the pre-dawn glow, a sense of shared understanding settled between them. “I’m so sorry for worrying you!” The surrogate apologized, “That’s never happened to me before!” But they only laughed and told her it’s okay. Life, in its infinite wisdom, had decided to give them a test run. A sneak peek into the beautiful chaos that awaited them. All those confident pronouncements about being "totally ready" now seemed… well, a little naive. ${OtherName} realized that while ${OtherSheHeThey}’d thought ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} prepared, the sheer, primal shock of the moment had temporarily derailed ${OtherHerHimThem}. ${PregnantName} learned that even the most well-practiced techniques could vanish under pressure.

      label: "Fully freak out",
      response: `The next few minutes dissolved into a chaotic, almost comical, blur. The initial shock didn’t dissipate; it solidified, trapping them in a vortex of frenzied panic. "Where are the bags?!" ${OtherName} bellowed, tripping over a laundry basket. "The hospital bag! The snacks! Your phone!" ${PregnantName} shrieked back, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice startlingly loud in the pre-dawn quiet, as ${PregnantSheHeThey} fumbled with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} jeans. Their usual considerate whispers were replaced by shouts, a desperate attempt to cut through the fog of their own alarm and actually accomplish something. It was as if they needed to shout at each other just to keep moving, to break the spell of paralysis that threatened to consume them. The perfectly constructed facade of readiness, built patiently over nine months, crumbled into dust around their ears.
In their haste, every movement seemed designed to go wrong. ${OtherName} stumbled out of the bedroom, one foot bare, the other sporting a single slipper. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} snatched car keys from the hook, only to discover, mere seconds later, they were the keys to ${PregnantName}’s old, defunct bicycle. ${PregnantName}, managing to pull on a top backwards, finally made it to the doorway, clutching a bag that, upon closer inspection, turned out to be filled with clean laundry instead of essential kitten items. Yet, through all the bumbling and shouting, they somehow, miraculously, made it to the car. ${OtherName} wrestled with the car seat base, grunting with effort, before finally remembering it was already installed. ${PregnantName}, squeezed into the passenger seat, buckled ${PregnantHerHimThem}self in, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face still etched with alarm.

They started driving towards the hospital before quickly realizing they forgot the surrogate!! They pulled an emergency u-turn to head to her house! When they arrived they used a spare key she had given them to come in and found her on the floor of her bedroom slowly making her way out. 

“I got you!” ${PregnantName} quickly ran to her side to help her up carefully.

“Come on, love, slow and steady,” ${PregnantSheHeThey} urged, gently helping her to her feet, ${OtherName}’s eyes scanning the surrogate’s face for any sign of worsening pain. The fear hadn't vanished, but it was now channeled into action.

The short, frantic journey to the car felt like a scene from an action movie, albeit one featuring a very pregnant woman and two slightly dazed parents-to-be. 
${OtherName} carefully helped her into the back seat, buckled her in, and practically leaped into the driver's side as ${PregnantName} got into the back beside her to hold her hand.

As ${OtherName} sped (perhaps a little too enthusiastically) down the quiet, tree-lined streets towards the hospital, a peculiar calm began to settle over their surrogate. The sharp, searing pain that had jolted her awake seemed to recede, replaced by a dull ache that felt… manageable. Her contractions, which had been coming fast and furious moments before, simply stopped. She frowned, perplexed, then said "${PregnantName}, ${OtherName},” Her voice was a little softer, "I think… I feel a lot better." ${OtherName}, still gripping the steering wheel like it was a lifeline, risked a glance. "Better?" ${OtherSheHeThey} gasped, ${OtherHerHisTheir} heart still pounding a frantic rhythm. "But… it was time!" ${PregnantName} said, perplexed. "I know," She admitted, a tentative smile touching her lips. "But it's just… gone."
Despite the sudden improvement, they decided to press on to the hospital. Better safe than sorry, after all. Upon their arrival, a kind, understanding doctor calmly listened to their breathless, jumbled account of the night’s events. After a thorough check-up, the doctor delivered the verdict: a false alarm. It was likely a "Braxton Hicks" contraction, a strong one at that, but not the real deal. She wasn't in labor just yet.
Overwhelmed, ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} looked at each other, and then, almost simultaneously, burst into a mix of relieved laughter and sheepish smiles. The adrenaline slowly drained away, leaving them utterly exhausted but profoundly grateful. They felt like life had thrown them a pop quiz, an unexpected pre-test for the main event, and they had, by all accounts, failed it spectacularly. Everything they thought they knew, every ounce of their meticulously constructed "readiness," had evaporated in a puff of smoke and panic.
“I’m so sorry for worrying you!” The surrogate apologized, “That’s never happened to me before!” But they only laughed and told her it’s okay. But as they drove her home in the dawn light, the city slowly stirring to life around them, a new perspective began to form. Yes, they had shouted, they had fumbled, they had made every comical mistake imaginable. Yet, despite the theatrical chaos and the complete meltdown of their composure, they had gotten themselves to the hospital. And that, in itself, was something. Perhaps this unexpected trial was exactly what they needed. It was a humbling, hilarious lesson that shattered their delusions of perfection. Maybe, just maybe, by letting go of their rigid ideas of how labor "should" unfold and accepting the beautiful, unpredictable messiness of it all, they would find a deeper, more genuine sense of readiness when the true "go time" finally arrived. And that, they realized, might be the most valuable preparation of all.
