  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `${PregnantName} gently rubbed the surrogate’s slightly rounded belly, a smile playing on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} lips. At five months pregnant, she was definitely showing, and the anticipation of meeting their little one was practically a constant hum between ${PregnantHerHimThem} and ${OtherName}. Today was a big day – their second-trimester check-up, complete with an ultrasound. The surrogate told them that she had done this before and they are going to have some fun! As they followed her into the clinic, hand-in-hand, their excitement was palpable, their eyes sparkling with shared dreams.
Inside the softly lit exam room, their doctor greeted them warmly. The seasoned surrogate lay back, and the cool gel was applied to her exposed belly. ${OtherName} squeezed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand as the ultrasound wand glided over her fur, and suddenly, there it was – a tiny, flickering image on the screen. Their Kitten! A wave of overwhelming love washed over them. ${PregnantName} felt tears prick ${PregnantHerHisTheir} eyes, quickly followed by a happy giggle when ${OtherName} leaned in and whispered, “Wow, already looks just like you, darling.” ${PregnantName} playfully nudged ${OtherHerHimThem}, pouting, “Are you saying that I look like a developing fetus?” They both chuckled, their hearts overflowing with profound joy.
The laughter, however, slowly faded as the doctor leaned closer to the screen, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} brow furrowing slightly. She spent a few moments in quiet contemplation, her expression shifting from pleasant to subtly concerned. She then turned to them, her voice calm but with an underlying seriousness. "Everything looks great physically," she began, "but some of the energy readings are a bit... unusual. It seems your kitten is having a little trouble with their developing clan power." ${PregnantName} and ${OtherName} exchanged a confused glance. 
"What does that mean, Doc?" ${OtherName} asked, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice tensing. The doctor explained that while rare, sometimes the initial development of these powers could be unstable, potentially leading to a weakened or even disabled ability later in life if not addressed. The words hung in the air, heavy and chilling. Their earlier joy evaporated, replaced by a sudden, gripping fear. The thought of their precious kitten facing such a challenge, so early on, was terrifying.
Seeing ${OtherHerHisTheir} distress, the doctor quickly reassured ${OtherHerHimThem}. "Don't worry, there is a solution. We can put her on some regulated medication, a supplement specifically designed to stabilize the energy flow.” 
 
It was a glimmer of hope, but one that came with significant caveats. The pills, he explained, were incredibly expensive, and even with the best intentions, there was no absolute guarantee of its success. ${OtherName} listened intently, ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind racing. Here was a chance, however slim, to give ${OtherHerHisTheir} child the best possible start, but at a cost that felt almost insurmountable – especially for a single floss already meticulously planning for every kitten expense.

Question 
Should They take the prescription?

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 3 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.
  // 1: fill in the "Option X" after the "label:" This will be what displays on the options buttons
  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"
  // 3: fill in the lowercase letter of the prompt the option leads to. Letters can be found on the image Ten made.
  const options = {
    "option1": {
      label: "Take it",
      response: `${OtherName} glanced at ${PregnantName}, then back at the doctor, a myriad of thoughts swirling in ${OtherHerHisTheir} head. The financial strain was daunting, a practical mountain rising before ${OtherHerHimThem}. Yet, looking at the ultrasound image on the screen, a tiny, developing life, ${OtherSheHeThey} knew there was only one choice ${OtherSheHeThey} could make. "We should take the prescription, ${PregnantName}," ${OtherName} said, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice firm, tinged with a quiet resolve. ${PregnantName} nodded, feeling the same rush of emotions. For them, the baby’s health was paramount, an absolute top priority that overshadowed any financial worry.
As they left the clinic, a weight had lifted from their shoulders, replaced by a surge of determination. The path ahead might be challenging, but they were ready, as long as they’re together. They'd figure out the payments, whether it meant exploring credit card options, reaching out to supportive family members for a loan, or finding extra work. Whatever it took, They would ensure their kittenfloss had every possible chance at a healthy life. The journey to parenthood was proving to be filled with unexpected turns, but they are ready to face them all, driven by an unwavering love for their little one yet to arrive.

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Don't take it",
      response: `After a few short moments of debate, ${OtherName} and  ${PregnantName} made their decision. With a few deep breaths, they politely declined the prescription. It was an agonizing choice, one rooted deeply in practicality and a profound love for their child. Getting into significant debt right now, for a treatment that might not even be effective, felt like a gamble they couldn't afford to lose. While the possibility of a power defect was undeniably daunting, the doctor had assured them it wouldn't threaten the kitten's life. They knew that any child, regardless of their needs, would be cherished by both of them.
They might look back on this moment with regret in the future, wondering "what if." But with the information they had now – the high cost, the uncertainty of success, and the non-critical nature of the potential issue – they knew they had to choose the path that ensured stability for their growing family. Instead of pouring money into a risky solution, they would pour their heart and resources into preparing for whatever lay ahead. Their focus now shifted to equipping themself, emotionally and practically, to welcome a child who might have special needs, and require a little extra love and support, ready to embrace every challenge and joy that came with being a dedicated parent.
