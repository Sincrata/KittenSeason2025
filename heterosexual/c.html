  const storyText = `${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} are absolutely bubbling with excitement, their hearts filled with an overwhelming mix of happiness and love as they begin their first trimester journey. Meeting their tiny new addition couldn't come soon enough!
Their first big project? The kitten's room. They spend hours laughing, poring over paint swatches and imagining playful murals. Soon, the walls begin to glow with bright, cheerful colors, ready for their kitten's arrival.
Just as their nursery dreams were taking shape, an incredible opportunity landed in ${OtherName}’s lap. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} company offered ${OtherHerHimThem} a new project promising significantly more income and, even better, the flexibility to work from home. This felt like a gift from above; more money meant they could provide even more for their little one, and ${OtherName}'s presence at home was a big plus. They celebrated, envisioning a secure future.
However, the reality of working from home quickly set in. With the half-finished nursery beckoning and the usual home distractions, ${OtherName} found it incredibly difficult to concentrate. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} work, usually sharp and efficient, began to suffer. The risk wasn't just losing this new project, but potentially jeopardizing ${OtherHerHisTheir} entire position. This was a crucial chance for their family's financial well-being.
One evening, they stood together in the vibrant, unfinished nursery, their eyes lingering on the hopeful splashes of paint. The stark reality was clear: for ${OtherName} to succeed in this crucial new role, ${OtherSheHeThey} needed a dedicated home office. And that room was the nursery. Their hearts were torn. Should their kittenfloss sleep in their room for a while, securing ${OtherName}'s career and their financial future? Or continue with the nursery, knowing ${OtherName} would spend longer hours at the office? It was a truly difficult decision, balancing immediate comfort with their long-term security.
