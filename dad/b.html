  const storyText = `${OtherName} is going to be a parent! The first trimester was supposed to be a time of quiet excitement, but for ${OtherName}, it was quickly turning into a whirlwind of information. Every free moment found ${OtherHerHimThem} scrolling through pregnancy blogs or tuning into a new prenatal health podcast. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherHasHave} been messaging ${OtherHersHisTheirs} surrogate non-stop with links to articles and advice and asking for her sleep schedule.
Soon, ${OtherHerHisTheir} newfound knowledge morphed into a strict regimen for the surrogate. ${OtherName} started bothering her about every little thing, even to the point where ${OtherSheHeThey} asked her to get a Fitbit and share her app with ${OtherHerHimThem} to monitor it. ${OtherName} couldn't hold a conversation without something leading ${OtherHerHimThem} down a tangent about prenatal vitamins or alternative birthing methods. "Did you know," ${OtherSheHeThey} 'd often begin, in conversations with friends or family, "that eating organic kale at precisely 7 PM can boost XYZ?" ${OtherName} didn’t mean to, but these increasingly specific, pushy rules were creating an air of constant stress for the surrogate mother.

 ${OtherName}’s surrogate was far too kind to say anything, but when push came to shove she knew that she had to put a stop to this nonsense. She understood ${OtherHerHisTheir} desire to be a good parent, but the constant worry and these neurotic behaviors were starting to wear on her. She tried to be patient, to empathize, but it was getting harder.
Is this just how ${OtherName} is? She pictured the next eight months – filled with an endless parade of health mandates and dietary restrictions. One more mention of a ‘superfood smoothie’ or a perfectly timed nap, and she felt a sharp knot of annoyance tightening in her chest. She was on the verge of snapping, unsure how much more she could take of the stress ${OtherName} was unknowingly creating for both her, the kitten, and ${OtherHerHimThem}self.

On one of their meet ups, ${OtherName} got on their soap box again, and started to go on and on about some new health test to determine the likelihood of some obscure birth defects and the surrogate finally snapped. She starts to go off on ${OtherHerHimThem} about how ridiculous ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} being!
 
Question 
How does ${OtherName} respond? Insist, Apologize, or Seek Help

  const options = {

      label: "Insist",
      response: `The weight of her words hung in the air. ${OtherName}, taken aback, quickly became defensive. "This is my kitten! This is my kitten we're talking about! I have every right to ensure everything is perfect. You have to do what I say!" The conversation quickly devolved into a heated argument, a clash of ${OtherHerHisTheir} anxious possessiveness against her need for bodily autonomy and respect. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} argued passionately about the risks and the importance of following every single guideline ${OtherSheHeThey}’d researched, while she pleaded for a modicum of trust and personal space.
The argument simmered for a painful while longer, leaving both parties drained. Finally, weary of the emotional battle and feeling an immense pressure to simply make it stop, the surrogate relented. "Fine, ${OtherName}," she sighed, her voice devoid of any real agreement, "I'll look at your 'optimal health plan.' Just send it over." It was a surrender born of exhaustion, not reconciliation. ${OtherName}, perhaps mistaking her capitulation for understanding, sent over a detailed, multi-page document outlining everything from her exact caloric intake to her daily step count and a mandatory meditation schedule. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} even included a precise schedule for her prenatal massages, complete with approved oils.
From that day forward, the nature of their communication dramatically altered. The surrogate became a different version of herself – polite, professional, and utterly distant. She would provide the health updates ${OtherName} demanded, concise and factual, dutifully ticking off the boxes of ${OtherHerHisTheir} 'optimal health plan.' But any other message, any attempt by ${OtherName} to engage in friendly banter, to ask about her day beyond her pregnancy symptoms, or to offer a casual observation, was met with silence. Texts went unread or unanswered for hours, even days. Calls were rarely picked up. The warmth, the rapport they had initially built, evaporated, replaced by a cold, transactional exchange of information. ${OtherName} was getting the data ${OtherSheHeThey} insisted on, but ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} losing the genuine connections in this incredibly personal journey they were on together.
${OtherName} had, in a sense, gotten what ${OtherSheHeThey} wanted: compliance. But at what cost? In ${OtherHerHisTheir} frantic quest for control and perfection, ${OtherSheHeThey} had inadvertently pushed away the very floss who was helping ${OtherHerHimThem} bring ${OtherHerHisTheir} dream to life.

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Apologize",
      response: ` A stunned silence followed. ${OtherName}, completely taken aback by her bluntness, processing her words. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} heard the exhaustion in her voice, the genuine frustration. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} immediately felt a wave of shame wash over him. "I-"${OtherSheHeThey}said, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice softer, laced with genuine regret, "You’re absolutely right. I am. I’m so, so sorry." ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} paused, taking a deep breath. "It’s just... it’s because I’m nervous. So nervous. Being away from the kittenfloss, not being able to physically be there, to do something to help, to make sure everything is okay... this is all I can think to do. I’m just trying to make sure everything is perfect, and I know I'm probably doing it all wrong."
She listened, her own initial anger softening into understanding. She heard the raw vulnerability in ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice, the underlying fear that fueled ${OtherHerHisTheir} overbearing behavior. It wasn't about distrust; it was about distance and a deep yearning to protect ${OtherHerHisTheir} kittenfloss. She remembered the sheer joy and hope in ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes when they first met, ${OtherHerHisTheir} fervent desire to be a parent. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere}n't trying to be difficult or dismissive of her role; ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} just a first-time parent, overwhelmed by the enormity of it all, and feeling helpless from afar.
"${OtherName}," she replied, her tone now much gentler, "I get it. I really do. It's a huge thing, and it's natural to be worried. Especially when you're not the one carrying the kitten. But we need to find a way for you to feel involved without me feeling like I’m under constant supervision." She thought for a moment. "How about this? Why don't we sit down, maybe over video call, and work something out? We can create a schedule for updates, discuss my dietary plan and any activities I’m doing, and build a framework that works for both of us. That way you know what’s happening, and I feel respected in my role."
${OtherName} eagerly agreed. The very next evening, they connected online. The atmosphere was entirely different from their recent interactions. Instead of an interrogation, it was a collaborative session. The surrogate patiently explained her typical day, her healthy eating habits, and the advice her doctor had given her. ${OtherName}, for ${OtherHerHisTheir} part, listened intently, offering suggestions that were now framed as thoughtful considerations rather than demands.
Together, they devised an update schedule which helped immensely in quelling some of ${OtherHerHisTheir} more unusual fears. ${OtherName} felt a profound sense of relief, knowing exactly when ${OtherSheHeThey} would receive updates and feeling truly involved in the planning rather than just reactive.

    ,"option3": {
      label: "Seek Help",
      response: `${OtherName}, initially startled, started to argue, ${OtherHerHisTheir} own anxieties bubbling to the surface. "But I'm just trying to make sure everything's perfect! I want what's best for the kitten!" ${OtherSheHeThey} protested, genuine concern laced with defensiveness.
The surrogate however, wasn't letting ${OtherHerHimThem} off the hook. She took a deep breath, realizing this went far beyond normal new-parent jitters. "${OtherName}," she said, her voice firm but calm, "I understand you're stressed, but this isn't sustainable. This conversation is over for now. You need to get some professional help to manage this anxiety. Seriously." With that, she gently but firmly got up and left.
The silence that followed was deafening for ${OtherName}. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} hurt, confused, and a little ashamed. Had ${OtherSheHeThey} really been that bad? The next morning, a text from the surrogate popped up, not an apology as ${OtherSheHeThey} might have hoped, but a number. "This is for a parental therapist," it read. "They can give you actual, real advice, not the pseudoscience you've been listening to."
Swallowing ${OtherHerHisTheir} pride, and driven by a desperate desire to repair ${OtherHerHisTheir} relationship with the surrogate and be the best parent ${OtherSheHeThey} could be, ${OtherName} made the call. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} first session with the Doctor was a revelation. The therapist listened patiently as ${OtherName} poured out ${OtherHerHisTheir} anxieties – ${OtherHerHisTheir} fear of the unknown, ${OtherHerHisTheir} lack of control over the physical aspects of the pregnancy, ${OtherHerHisTheir} overwhelming desire to ensure everything was perfect for ${OtherHerHisTheir} future kittenfloss.
The Doctor validated ${OtherHerHisTheir} feelings, acknowledging that it was natural to feel anxious, especially in a surrogacy journey where a significant part of the process was out of ${OtherHerHisTheir} direct control. But the doctor also gently but firmly dismantled ${OtherName}'s reliance on unverified internet advice and pointed out how ${OtherHerHisTheir} attempts to control the surrogate were counterproductive, creating stress for everyone involved. The doctor helped ${OtherName} understand that trust was paramount in this unique relationship, and that ${OtherHerHisTheir} energy would be better spent focusing on what ${OtherSheHeThey} could control: ${OtherHerHisTheir} own preparation for parenthood. It was as if a heavy fog had lifted, opening ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes to a truth ${OtherSheHeThey} hadn't seen.
A few days later, a humbled ${OtherName} called the surrogate, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice softer than she'd heard it in weeks, "I am so incredibly sorry. You were completely right. I've been neurotic, controlling, and unfair. I went to see a therapist, and it… it really opened my eyes. You are a professional, and I trust you completely with this process. I was out of line."
She listened, a touch of relief in her voice when she finally responded. "Thank you, ${OtherName}. I appreciate you saying that. I know this is a big deal for you."
${OtherName} paused, a lingering sense of helplessness still present, but now channeled constructively. "I still feel a bit helpless, though," ${OtherSheHeThey} admitted. "If you trust me and I trust you, what can I do to help? What should I be doing?"
A warm smile touched her lips, even though ${OtherName} couldn't see it. This was the ${OtherName} she could work with. "That's a great question, ${OtherName}," she said. "Here's what would really help: Focus on preparing for the kitten's arrival in your home. Research kittenfloss equipment – not just what's safest, but what fits your lifestyle. Start setting up the nursery. Maybe join a reputable, in-person parenting class – they'll teach you about caring for a newborn, which is where your focus needs to be. You could also help me out by researching local support groups for new single parents. And when the time comes, if you want to be truly helpful, bringing over some healthy, pre-made meals for me in my last trimester and after delivery would be a huge relief. Think about what you can do to build your own support system and become the amazing parent you're meant to be, rather than trying to manage my pregnancy."
${OtherName} listened, a renewed sense of purpose washing over him. These were tangible, empowering tasks. These were things ${OtherSheHeThey} could control, things that built trust rather than eroded it. The journey ahead was still long, but now, with newfound understanding and a clearer path, ${OtherName} was ready to embrace it, not just as an expectant parent, but as a supportive, trusting partner in bringing ${OtherHerHisTheir} kittenfloss into the world.
