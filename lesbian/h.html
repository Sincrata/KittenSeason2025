  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `${PregnantName} gently rubbed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} slightly rounded belly, a smile playing on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} lips. At five months pregnant, ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} definitely showing, and the anticipation of meeting their little one was practically a constant hum between ${PregnantHerHimThem} and ${OtherName}. Today was a big day – their second-trimester check-up, complete with an ultrasound. As they walked into the clinic, hand-in-hand, their excitement was palpable, their eyes sparkling with shared dreams.
Inside the softly lit exam room, their doctor greeted them warmly. ${PregnantName} lay back, and the cool gel was applied to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} exposed belly. ${OtherName} squeezed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand as the ultrasound wand glided over ${PregnantHerHisTheir} fur, and suddenly, there it was – a tiny, flickering image on the screen. Their Kitten! A wave of overwhelming love washed over them. ${PregnantName} felt tears prick ${PregnantHerHisTheir} eyes, quickly followed by a happy giggle when ${OtherName} leaned in and whispered, “Wow, already look just like you, darling.” ${PregnantName} playfully nudged ${OtherHerHimThem}, pouting, “Are you saying that I look like a developing fetus?” They both chuckled, their hearts overflowing with profound joy.
The laughter, however, slowly faded as the doctor leaned closer to the screen, her brow furrowing slightly. She spent a few moments in quiet contemplation, her expression shifting from pleasant to subtly concerned. She then turned to them, her voice calm but with an underlying seriousness. "Everything looks great physically," She began, "but some of the energy readings are a bit... unusual. It seems your baby is having a little trouble with their developing clan power." ${PregnantName} and ${OtherName} exchanged a confused glance. 
"What does that mean, Doc?" ${OtherName} asked, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice tensing. The doctor explained that while rare, sometimes the initial development of these powers could be unstable, potentially leading to a weakened or even disabled ability later in life if not addressed. The words hung in the air, heavy and chilling. Their earlier joy evaporated, replaced by a sudden, gripping fear. ${PregnantName}’s hand instinctively went to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} belly, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart pounding. The thought of their precious kitten facing such a challenge, so early on, was terrifying.
Seeing their distress, the doctor quickly reassured them. "Don't worry, there's a very straightforward solution. We can put ${PregnantName} on some regulated medication, a supplement specifically designed to stabilize the energy flow. It's safe for both of you and it should correct the issue long before birth." A collective sigh of relief escaped them both. The tension in the room dissipated almost instantly. ${PregnantName} and ${OtherName} looked at each other, a profound sense of gratitude washing over them. An easy fix. They eagerly accepted the prescription, already feeling lighter, their hopes and happiness restored. They left the clinic, once again hand-in-hand, their hearts full of renewed optimism for their little one, knowing they were doing everything they could to ensure their baby's healthy future.

  // 3: fill in the lowercase letter of the prompt the option leads to. Letters can be found on the image Ten made.
