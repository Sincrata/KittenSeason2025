  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `${PregnantName} and ${OtherName} were navigating the final stretch of pregnancy, a mix of exhaustion and boundless excitement. ${PregnantName}, in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} third trimester, was quite literally carrying a heavy load, but the thought of meeting their baby kept them going. Things had been stressful, yet by supporting one another and taking things one step at a time, they felt prepared for what was to come, keenly anticipating their little one’s arrival and, frankly, the end of pregnancy itself.
Feeling the time coming soon, ${PregnantName} started to get nervous. There was so much ${PregnantSheHeThey} wanted to do before the baby was born. Though a lot of things could be ordered to the house, ${PregnantSheHeThey} couldn't avoid shopping in person for some of the last-minute items ${PregnantSheHeThey} wanted for the baby. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} loved ${OtherName}, but ${PregnantSheHeThey} didn’t trust ${OtherHerHimThem} to pick out the "very perfect" things.
One day, the two were on their way home from the store together with a car full of infant supplies when the car suddenly sputtered and stopped on the side of the road. The car wouldn't start, and it was very hot outside. For a while they tried to get it to start, but the heat started to get to ${PregnantName}. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} grew irritable and began to fight with ${OtherName}. ${PregnantName} insisted they should call a tow, but ${OtherName} argued that was too expensive for how close they were to home. They were only a mile or so away from the house, but ${PregnantName} wasn’t able to walk that far – not in this heat, not this heavily pregnant. ${OtherName} kept trying to get the car to start, but ${PregnantName} was sweating profusely, and ${OtherName} was genuinely concerned about the worsening heat.
The sun beat down relentlessly, making the inside of the stranded car feel like an oven. ${PregnantName} fanned ${PregnantHerHimThem}self with a baby blanket, ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} patience wearing thin. "${OtherName}, please! I can't breathe in here. Just call the tow truck. We'll figure out the money later, but I need to get out of this heat."
 ${OtherName}, leaning over the engine, sighed, ${OtherHerHisTheir} brow slick with sweat. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} knew ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} right, but the thought of another unexpected expense was daunting. Still, one look at ${PregnantName}'s flushed, discomforted face erased ${OtherHerHisTheir} financial concerns. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} well-being, and the baby's, was paramount.
Question 
What does ${OtherName} do? Carry or Call a tow truck?

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 3 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.
  // 1: fill in the "Option X" after the "label:" This will be what displays on the options buttons
  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"
  // 3: fill in the lowercase letter of the prompt the option leads to. Letters can be found on the image Ten made.
  const options = {
    "option1": {
      label: "Carry",
      response: `${OtherName}, seeing ${PregnantName} wilting and genuinely worried about the heat's impact on ${PregnantHerHimThem} and the baby, knew ordinary solutions wouldn't cut it. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} made a snap decision. Locking up the car, ${OtherSheHeThey} turned to ${PregnantName}. With a gentle grin, ${OtherSheHeThey} scooped ${PregnantHerHimThem} up into ${OtherHerHisTheir} arms, bridal style. "Alright, my love," ${OtherSheHeThey} declared, "we're walking this home." And so, like a modern-day knight, ${OtherName} began trudging down the road, carrying ${OtherHerHisTheir} beloved princess and their unborn child towards their neighborhood. It wasn't long before a true good Samaritan, witnessing this heartwarming and slightly comical scene, pulled over. The kind stranger offered them a ride, and the blast of air conditioning in their car was nothing short of heaven for ${PregnantName}. Once ${PregnantName} and the baby were safely home, cooled down with water and resting, ${OtherName}, resolute, made ${OtherHerHisTheir} way back to their stranded vehicle. After another hour of tinkering and sheer willpower, the engine finally sputtered to life, and ${OtherSheHeThey} drove it home, triumphant. They were both exhausted but incredibly grateful, their bond strengthened by another adventure survived together.

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Call a tow truck",
      response: `${PregnantName} was clearly overheating, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face flushed and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} movements sluggish. ${OtherName}'s concern mounted with every passing second; the expense suddenly seemed trivial compared to ${PregnantName}'s discomfort and the potential risk to their baby.
Taking a deep breath, ${OtherName} finally put down ${OtherHerHisTheir} tools. "You're right," ${OtherSheHeThey} said, the words a little tough to get out, but ${OtherHerHisTheir} resolve was firm. "Your health, and the baby's, are way more important than a few extra bucks." ${OtherSheHeThey} pulled out ${OtherHerHisTheir} phone and, swallowing ${OtherHerHisTheir} pride, called for a tow. To their relief, only fifteen minutes later, a large tow truck pulled up. Soon, their sputtering car was hitched to the back, and ${PregnantName} and ${OtherName} were gratefully climbing into the blessed air-conditioned cab. It was indeed a remarkably pricey mile, but as ${PregnantName} started to cool down, ${PregnantSheHeThey} knew it was entirely worth every penny.
Once they were safely home and ${PregnantName} was comfortably settled, the tension from the roadside ordeal fully dissipated. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} looked at ${OtherName}, who was still slightly flushed from the heat and the stress, and offered ${OtherHerHimThem} a heartfelt smile. "Thank you, ${OtherName}," ${PregnantSheHeThey} said, reaching for ${OtherHerHisTheir} hand. "Thank you for putting me and the baby first, even when it was frustrating. You always do." ${OtherName} squeezed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand, a soft smile returning to ${OtherHerHisTheir} face. They were so close now, so incredibly close, and moments like these only reinforced their readiness for the wonderful, chaotic adventure that lay just around the corner.
