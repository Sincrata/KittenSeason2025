  const storyText = ` ${OtherName} was practically bouncing with excitement. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} surrogate mother was well into her second trimester, and her baby bump was beautifully undeniable. Today was an appointment day, and ${OtherSheHeThey} couldn't wait to see her. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} imagined ${OtherHerHisTheir} little one, growing bigger and stronger with each passing week, and a warmth spread through ${OtherHerHisTheir} cheeks that had nothing to do with the summer heat.
When ${OtherSheHeThey} arrived, ${OtherHerHisTheir} surrogate greeted ${OtherHerHimThem} with a cheerful smile. She glowed with a special kind of radiance and, without a word, extended her belly towards ${OtherHerHimThem}. ${OtherName} eagerly accepted the unspoken invitation, ${OtherHerHisTheir} hands gently pressing onto her warm, firm stomach. It was an instant connection, a tangible link to the precious life flourishing within. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} felt closer to ${OtherHerHisTheir} kitten than ever, a quiet joy settling over ${OtherHerHimThem} as ${OtherSheHeThey} imagined tiny kicks and flutters. The appointment went smoothly, with happy reports from the doctor, only adding to ${OtherHerHisTheir} already overflowing spirits.
As ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} saying ${OtherHerHisTheir} goodbye, still beaming, ${OtherSheHeThey} leaned in and softly whispered, "Bye, bye, Kitten!" 

“Still deciding on a name?” she asked. 

${OtherName} sighed, a mix of amusement and exasperation in the sound. “You got me,” ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} confessed, running a hand through ${OtherHerHisTheir} hair. “It’s driving me absolutely batty. Honestly, I’ve got lists, spreadsheets even, and I just can’t seem to commit.”
The surrogate stands straight, placing a hand on her stomach. “It’s a big decision, that’s for sure,” she acknowledged. “But hey, no pressure. You’ve got some time. My advice? Don’t overthink it. Sometimes the right name just feels right, you know? And sometimes, a name with a deep meaning is perfect. It’s about what resonates with you and what you want for them. Do you want to pass on a legacy, or just give them something beautiful to say?”
Her words, delivered with easy wisdom, lingered in ${OtherName}’s mind as ${OtherSheHeThey} drove home. For the next few days, her advice became a constant echo in ${OtherHerHisTheir} thoughts, a gentle hum beneath the surface of ${OtherHerHisTheir} daily life. What resonates with me? Legacy or beauty? The question spun round and round, opening up a whole new layer of contemplation.
He found ${OtherHerHimThem}self spending hours staring at ${OtherHerHisTheir} carefully curated lists. On one side were names steeped in history and significance: family names like Arthur or Eleanor, names meaning "brave" or "wise," names connected to nature or virtues ${OtherSheHeThey} cherished. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} imagined telling ${OtherHerHisTheir} child the story behind their name, the meaning woven into its very fabric, a subtle guidance for their path through life. It felt substantial, a gift of identity from the very beginning.
But then, on another part of ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind’s whiteboard (both literal and metaphorical), were names that simply sounded lovely. Names that rolled off the tongue, felt light and airy, or had a charming cadence. Names like Leo or Willow, Chloe or Finn. These names didn't necessarily carry a heavy historical burden or a profound philosophical meaning, but they evoked a sense of comfort, joy, or elegance. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} pictured calling out one of these names on a playground, or whispering it softly as ${OtherSheHeThey} rocked ${OtherHerHisTheir} kitten to sleep, and it felt just as right, just as full of love.
The dilemma gnawed at ${OtherHerHimThem}. Was ${OtherSheHeThey} supposed to choose a name that would inspire ${OtherHerHisTheir} child to greatness, to live up to some inherent meaning? Or was it enough to pick a name that simply sounded pleasant, that brought a smile to ${OtherHerHisTheir} face, and allowed ${OtherHerHisTheir} child the freedom to define its own meaning? ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} debated with ${OtherHerHimThem}self late into the nights, consulting kitten name books, online forums, and even ${OtherHerHisTheir} elderly neighbour, Mrs. Henderson, who offered a delightful but ultimately unhelpful suggestion of 'Ferdinand' for a boy or 'Gertrude' for a girl.
${OtherName} longed for a sign, a moment of clarity that would point ${OtherHerHimThem} decisively in one direction. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} pictured ${OtherHerHisTheir} kitten's face, still a blurry image in ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind, and wondered what name would suit it best. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} knew, deep down, that no matter what ${OtherSheHeThey} chose, it would be a name filled with love, a testament to the incredible journey ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} on. But for now, the sweet burden of choosing remained, a delightful, daunting task that ${OtherSheHeThey} knew, eventually, ${OtherSheHeThey} would conquer. After all, the perfect name was out there, waiting patiently to be discovered, just like ${OtherHerHisTheir} little one. 


Question 
What do they decide to do? Nice-sounding name or Meaningful name

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place

      response: ` Then, one quiet morning, as ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} humming to ${OtherHerHimThem}self while making breakfast, a name simply popped into ${OtherHerHisTheir} head. It wasn't a name ${OtherSheHeThey} had researched for its profound meaning. It wasn't a name passed down through generations in ${OtherHerHisTheir} family. It was just a name. A name that sounded warm, inviting, and felt intrinsically right when ${OtherSheHeThey} thought of ${OtherHerHisTheir} future child. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} said it aloud, testing it, letting it linger on ${OtherHerHisTheir} tongue. And a smile, genuine and unforced, finally spread across ${OtherHerHisTheir} face.
The realization washed over ${OtherHerHimThem} with a wave of peaceful certainty. The surrogate had been absolutely right. The name didn't need to carry the weight of the world or possess some hidden, ancient significance. It didn't need a story to justify its existence beyond the simple fact that it was the name ${OtherSheHeThey} loved, the name that felt like a perfect fit for the little person ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} about to meet.
He imagined the day, years from now, when ${OtherHerHisTheir} child, curious and eager, might ask, "Why did you pick my name?" ${OtherName} knew exactly what ${OtherSheHeThey} would say. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} wouldn't weave a complex tale of ancestral heroes or cosmic connections. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} would simply smile, look into their eyes, and say, "Because it was the right name, just for you. And that’s all there is to it." And in that moment, for ${OtherName}, it was more than enough. It was perfect.

      label: "Meaning",
      response: `Then, one quiet evening, as ${OtherSheHeThey} sat gazing out ${OtherHerHisTheir} window at the city lights, it clicked. It wasn't a name he'd seen on any list that day, nor one he'd considered before. It was a name that had always resided in the back of ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind, a name he'd admired for its inherent strength and classic appeal. And suddenly, with the Surrogate's words echoing in ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind, ${OtherSheHeThey} realized it was the perfect middle ground.
The name wasn't just beautiful to hear; it resonated with a power and a noble quality that deeply appealed to ${OtherHerHimThem}. It carried a subtle, yet profound meaning – one that spoke of resilience, leadership, and a bright future. It was a name that had historically been associated with individuals who carved their own paths, who inspired others, and who stood for something greater than themselves. It was a name ${OtherSheHeThey} genuinely liked, a name ${OtherSheHeThey} felt a connection to, independent of any external pressures.
A wave of profound relief washed over ${OtherName}. This wasn't just a name; it was a promise. It was a beacon, a gentle push towards greatness without being overbearing. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} could already picture the moment, years from now, when ${OtherHerHisTheir} child would look up at ${OtherHerHimThem} with curious eyes and ask, "Why did you pick my name?" And ${OtherName} knew exactly what ${OtherSheHeThey} would say. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} would tell them of the great legacy they were continuing, of the values and strength embedded in their very identity, and how their name was a testament to the powerful, empowered person they were destined to become. The search was over; the perfect name had found its way home.
