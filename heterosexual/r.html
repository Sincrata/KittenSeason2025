  const storyText = `The nursery was painted a calming shade of green, tiny outfits were folded neatly in drawers, and the hospital bag, packed with meticulous care, stood ready by the door. ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName}, a couple brimming with excited anticipation, were just days away from their due date. ${PregnantName}, carrying their precious cargo, was now a majestic, though heavily burdened, silhouette of impending parenthood. ${OtherName}, ever the planner, had arranged ${OtherHerHisTheir} family leave to begin at the end of the week, ensuring ${OtherSheHeThey}'d be there for every momentous second. But as life often does, it had a flair for the dramatic, and one particular evening decided to rewrite their carefully orchestrated timeline.
That evening found ${PregnantName} alone, navigating the increasingly challenging landscape of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} own home. Simple tasks, like putting away clean dishes, had become Olympic feats. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} perfectly round, prominently protruding belly seemed to have a mind of its own, constantly getting in the way. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} stretched, grunting softly, to reach a top shelf, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} fingers grasping for a clean coffee cup. Just as ${PregnantSheHeThey} secured it, a sharp, searing pain seized ${PregnantHerHimThem}. It wasn't the dull ache of late pregnancy; this was something fierce, demanding, undeniably a contraction. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} breath hitched, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} eyes widened in primal fear. The world spun for a moment, then narrowed to the rhythmic ebb and flow of the pain. When it finally receded, leaving ${PregnantHerHimThem} trembling and breathless, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mind latched onto one name: ${OtherName}. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} fingers, fumbling with a sudden tremor, reached for ${PregnantHerHisTheir} phone.
Miles away, in the hushed, late-evening world of ${OtherHerHisTheir} office, ${OtherName}'s phone hummed a silent, desperate symphony on ${OtherHerHisTheir} desk. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} oblivious. A critical, last-minute review had spirited ${OtherHerHimThem} away to a separate conference room. ${PregnantName} called, an insistent series of vibrations that went unnoticed. One, two, three, then a fourth attempt, each buzz a silent plea, swallowed by the focused intensity of the discussion. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} phone, discreetly set to vibrate mode to avoid disturbing ${OtherHerHisTheir} colleagues, kept ${PregnantName}’s growing distress entirely to itself.
Back home, the silence stretched, punctuated only by ${PregnantName}'s increasingly ragged breaths and the distant echo of a fresh contraction building. Four missed calls to ${OtherName}. A cold, sharp tendril of panic snaked its way around ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart. Why wasn't ${OtherSheHeThey} answering? Had something happened to ${OtherHerHimThem}? The fear for their imminent arrival mingled with a terrifying worry for ${PregnantHerHisTheir} partner. Alone and increasingly overwhelmed, ${PregnantSheHeThey} changed tack, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} fingers flying to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mother's number. It felt like an eternity for the connection to be made, but finally, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mother's worried voice cut through the static. Not long after, the front door burst open, and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mother rushed in, her face a mask of profound concern. She found ${PregnantName}, not just in labor, but in tears, terrified, and utterly unable to reach the one person ${PregnantSheHeThey} needed most.
As the critical work meeting finally wound down, ${OtherName} stretched, eager to be home. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} reached for ${OtherHerHisTheir} phone, only for ${OtherHerHisTheir} heart to sink slightly as ${OtherSheHeThey} saw the stubbornly black screen. Battery dead. A minor annoyance, easily rectified once ${OtherSheHeThey} got in ${OtherHerHisTheir} car, ${OtherSheHeThey} thought. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} began gathering ${OtherHerHisTheir} belongings, ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind already drifting to ${PregnantName} and the quiet comfort of their apartment. But just as ${OtherSheHeThey} shrugged on ${OtherHerHisTheir} jacket, a frazzled colleague approached ${OtherHerHimThem}. “${OtherName}, you’re an expert in this, could you just quickly help me with this one thing?” ${OtherName}, always willing to lend a hand, agreed. What seemed like a 'quick fix' morphed into a complex problem. Time, that mischievous thief, accelerated, an hour slipping by unnoticed as ${OtherName} became entirely engrossed in troubleshooting a critical system issue with ${OtherHerHisTheir} coworker.
It wasn't until ${OtherSheHeThey} finally settled into ${OtherHerHisTheir} car, the engine purring to life, and plugged ${OtherHerHisTheir} phone into the charging port that the digital dam broke. Message after message flooded ${OtherHerHisTheir} screen, each notification a sharp jolt to ${OtherHerHisTheir} system. Missed calls from ${PregnantName}, then a volley of terse, urgent texts from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mother – words like 'labor,' 'hospital,' 'where are you?!' flashing before ${OtherHerHisTheir} disbelieving eyes. A profound, icy dread seeped into ${OtherHerHisTheir} bones. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} heart hammered against ${OtherHerHisTheir} ribs as ${OtherSheHeThey} immediately called ${PregnantName}, the ringing tone a frantic drumbeat in ${OtherHerHisTheir} ears. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} mother answered, her voice a furious torrent of accusations and worry, "You left ${PregnantHerHimThem} alone! ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} crying for you, ${OtherName}!" And then, mid-scolding, the phone died again, the battery apparently delivering its last, cruel gasp. Reality slammed into ${OtherName} like a physical blow. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} going to miss it. They were at the hospital. Without a second thought, ${OtherSheHeThey} swerved, making a swift, decisive lane change, and pressed the accelerator. Every fiber of ${OtherHerHisTheir} being screamed one thing: ${OtherSheHeThey} would not miss this. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} could not miss the birth of their precious child.
${OtherName} burst through the hospital doors, a whirlwind of adrenaline, apologies, and sheer desperate hope. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} found ${PregnantName}, surprisingly, calm. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} propped up in bed, sipping contentedly on a juice box, hooked up to a few monitors but clearly not in immediate distress. The monumental wave of relief that washed over ${OtherHerHimThem} was almost incapacitating, threatening to buckle ${OtherHerHisTheir} knees. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} could have never forgiven ${OtherHerHimThem}self, not in a million years, if ${OtherSheHeThey} had missed the profound moment of their child’s arrival because of a dead phone and a lingering work task. ${PregnantName}’s mom, though, wasn’t quite so easily appeased. She launched into a lengthy, well-deserved earful about leaving her daughter alone and terrified, her voice sharp with maternal protectiveness. ${OtherName} took it all, nodding, apologizing profusely, ${OtherHerHisTheir} relief too immense to feel anything but gratitude. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} just so overwhelmingly thankful to be there, by ${PregnantName}’s side.
Several more hours crawled by, a lengthy but ultimately triumphant labor unfolded. And through every contraction, every breathless push, ${OtherName} was unwavering, a steadfast anchor. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} held ${PregnantName}’s hand, whispered words of encouragement, wiped ${PregnantHerHisTheir} brow, and mirrored ${PregnantHerHisTheir} incredible strength. When their precious baby finally entered the world, crying its first mighty cry, ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} were together, hand in hand, their eyes locked on the tiny, new life before them. It had been a chaotic, nerve-wracking journey, filled with unexpected twists and agonizing moments of doubt. But as they looked at their child, perfect and miraculous, clasped together in that sacred moment, it was clear: every second of the struggle had been worth it. They were a family, complete, and the most beautiful chapter of their lives had just begun.
