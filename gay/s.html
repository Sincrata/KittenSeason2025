  const storyText = `The air in ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName}’s home hummed with a unique blend of anticipation and profound love. Pictures and updates from the surrogate were frequent. Their surrogate, wonderfully round and heavy with child in her third trimester, was a bundle of smiles and sunshine. The due date, once a distant point on the calendar, was now just a whisper away, hanging in the air like a cherished secret. They felt ready, truly ready, not just with their nursery meticulously prepared and their hospital bag packed, but deep in their hearts. An eager impatience fluttered within them, a desire to finally meet the tiny kitten who had already filled their lives with so much joy and wonder.
As the days dwindled, a significant milestone arrived: their parental leaves. It was a moment they had both been looking forward to, a tangible sign that their new chapter was truly beginning. To celebrate this quiet, momentous occasion, they opted for an intimate home date. The evening unfolded with the simple perfection of shared comfort: a stack of their favorite movies, the undeniable guilty pleasure of a large, cheesy pizza, and the soft glow of lamplight. Snuggled together on the couch, the weight of daily life melted away, leaving only the profound, enveloping warmth of their love for one another. It was a precious pause before the beautiful chaos, a final embrace of their lives as a duo before becoming a family.
The next few days, despite the underlying excitement, seemed to stretch lazily, each hour feeling longer than the last. They busied themselves with last-minute preparations: washing tiny clothes, arranging the few remaining items in the nursery, and double-checking their hospital bag for the tenth time. But mostly, they simply spent time together, savoring the quiet moments, holding hands, and sharing hopeful glances. They walked around their neighborhood, chatted about their hopes and dreams for their kitten, and just waited. The clock's hands, in their minds, moved at a snail's pace, each tick a gentle reminder that their little one was on their own schedule.
Then, when they least expected it, but perhaps at the most opportune moment, the quiet waiting came to an end. ${PregnantName} was enjoying a peaceful soak, as ${PregnantSheHeThey} hummed a soft tune to ${PregnantHerHimThem}self. It was a moment of pure, calming solitude, a brief respite from the ever-present anticipation. Suddenly, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} phone began to ring on the bathroom counter out of reach. It was the ring tone specifically chosen for the surrogate mother! ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} panicked and nearly slipped and fell as ${PregnantSheHeThey} rushed to cross the small room and pick up the phone!
“${OtherName}!” ${PregnantSheHeThey} called, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice a mix of surprise and exhilaration, the sudden urgency cutting through the peaceful quiet. They answered the call.
${OtherName}, ever attentive, burst into the bathroom in an instant, ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes wide with concern that quickly transformed into overflowing excitement as ${OtherSheHeThey} registered the look on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} turned to ${OtherName} to confirm, “It’s time!”

The air crackled with a new energy. There was a flurry of movement as ${OtherSheHeThey} got the car ready as the sopping wet ${PregnantName} dried quickly and threw on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} clothes. Within moments, they were buckled into their car on their way to pick up their surrogate mother, focus already sharpening. They were excited, undeniably frantic, but remarkably, they had things under control. This was it!
They picked her up from her house, and ${PregnantName} rode in the back seat with her, holding her hand. The drive to the hospital was a unique blend of tension and triumph. ${PregnantName} helped her lean into each contraction, focusing on the calm, rhythmic breathing they had practiced, while ${OtherName} offered words of encouragement. Traffic, thankfully, was light; it was mid-morning, and the usual rush had subsided, allowing them a relatively smooth journey. Each turn of the wheel brought them closer to their destination, closer to meeting their child.
Upon reaching the hospital, time seemed to pick up an incredible pace. To ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName}, every second felt like it was racing by, a blur of new faces, quick questions, and medical checks. In reality, their surrogate’s labor, while intense, was manageable, lasting nearly two hours from the first contraction to the final push. But in the heightened reality of the moment, it felt like mere minutes.
Then came the words they had longed to hear, delivered calmly by the doctor but echoing like a grand announcement in the room: "It's time to push." An overwhelming wave of excitement washed over ${OtherName} and ${PregnantName}, a surge of adrenaline and profound joy. This was it, the culmination of nine months of waiting, preparing, and dreaming. The delivery was remarkably smooth, a testament to their surrogate’s strength and the coordinated efforts of the medical team. In a matter of minutes, a new, precious cry filled the room, a sound that instantly transformed their world.
Soon after, they were back in their quiet hospital room, their darling kitten nestled securely in ${PregnantName}’s arms. The tiny being, a miracle made real, looked up at them with eyes they knew they would never tire of exploring. ${OtherName}, tears glistening in ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes, carefully sat beside ${PregnantName}, ${OtherHerHisTheir} hand reaching out to gently run a finger over their precious kitten’s soft, downy head. It was a touch so tender, so full of love, that it spoke volumes. As their gazes met over their newborn, the two new parents shared a tender kiss, a silent promise, a shared understanding of the profound shift that had just occurred. In that moment, with their child safe in their arms, surrounded by the quiet hum of the hospital, everything felt utterly, perfectly complete.
