  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `${OtherName} and ${PregnantName} were deep into their second trimester, eagerly awaiting their little one. While the excitement was palpable, so was the overwhelming feeling that came with it.  ${PregnantName}, in particular, found ${PregnantHerHimThem}self on an emotional rollercoaster. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} body was changing in ways ${PregnantSheHeThey} hadn't imagined, and  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} mind was a constant whirl of stress and anxiety – worries about the baby’s health, the fear of losing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} job, and just generally keeping everything together when their lives already felt like a juggling act. It was beautiful, but also incredibly exhausting.
Lately, ${PregnantName} felt like ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} perpetually on a short fuse. A trivial disagreement with another shopper at the grocery store had  ${PregnantHerHimThem} fuming for hours. The familiar smell of  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} workplace, once a comfort, now made ${PregnantHerHisTheir} stomach churn with nausea. Even  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} favorite, most comfortable shoes had become instruments of torture, leaving  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} swollen feet aching by the end of the day.  ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} ${PregnantWasWere} ready to tear someone's head off, and often, that someone ended up being poor ${OtherName}.
One moment, ${OtherName} was ${PregnantHerHisTheir} loving, supportive partner, the floss  ${PregnantSheHeThey} adored. The next, the sound of ${OtherHerHimThem} chewing too loudly or ${OtherHerHisTheir} innocent attempt to hold ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand when  ${PregnantSheHeThey} just wanted space would send a wave of irrational irritation through  ${PregnantHerHimThem}. It had to be the mood swings, ${PregnantSheHeThey} knew, but  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} patience was wearing thin. ${PregnantSheHeThey} tried to remind  ${PregnantHerHimThem}self that ${OtherSheHeThey} was just trying to be sweet, that ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} excited too. Yet, as ${OtherSheHeThey} leaned in for a kiss, a distinct garlic aroma preceding ${OtherHerHisTheir} lips, ${PregnantSheHeThey} braced  ${PregnantHerHimThem}self. Surely, ${OtherSheHeThey} wouldn't dare.
Question 
What ${PregnantDoesDo} ${PregnantSheHeThey} decide to do? Fight or Give In?

  // ✅ Step 2: Define your options in one place
  // Each option has 2 things to fill in. Remove the code block for unused options.
  // 1: fill in the "Option X" after the "label:" This will be what displays on the options buttons
  // 2: fill in the text for the options in between the `` after the "response"
  // Note: the response that has l as its next page is the one that does NOT lead to twins.
  const options = {
    "option1": {
      label: "Give In",
      response: `${PregnantName} inwardly cringed, but  ${PregnantSheHeThey} accepted  ${OtherName}’s affectionate gesture, not wanting to reject ${OtherHerHisTheir} love, even if it made  ${PregnantHerHimThem} feel a little queasy. Thankfully, ${OtherName} seemed to pick up on  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} subtle discomfort and gently asked if ${PregnantSheHeThey}  ${PregnantWasWere} okay. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} admitted everything to ${OtherHerHimThem}, letting all  ${PregnantHerHisTheir} pent-up anger and frustration pour out. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} listened patiently, then decided to do what ${OtherSheHeThey} could to make ${PregnantHerHimThem} feel better.
A few days later, ${OtherName} surprised ${PregnantHerHimThem} with a full spa day at home. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)}’d meticulously planned it: calming music, free back rubs, and, thankfully, only fresh, minty kisses. While ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hormones weren’t going anywhere soon, the thoughtful gesture was a powerful reminder that ${OtherName} was truly considerate of ${PregnantHerHisTheir} feelings and genuinely wanted to help. Amidst all the chaos, ${PregnantSheHeThey} felt truly loved and seen.

    ,"option2": {
      label: "Fight",
      response: `${OtherName}, wanting to be sweet, leaned in for a kiss. ${PregnantName}, catching a whiff of garlic, recoiled. "Ugh, ${OtherName}! That's disgusting! Can't you be considerate?" ${PregnantSheHeThey} snapped, dodging ${OtherHerHisTheir} lips. ${OtherName}, dejected and surprised by ${PregnantHerHisTheir} harshness, immediately retorted. Their argument escalated, filling the quiet home with frustrated voices. Later that night, as they lay in bed, a heavy silence hung between them. After a long moment of reflection, ${PregnantName}'s anger softened into remorse. ${PregnantSheHeThey} turned to ${OtherName}, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice quiet, "I'm so sorry. I know I overreacted." ${OtherName} gently reached for ${PregnantHerHimThem}, giving ${PregnantHerHimThem} a soft, freshly-brushed kiss on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} forehead. "I understand, love," ${OtherSheHeThey} whispered, and the tension in the room finally melted away`
