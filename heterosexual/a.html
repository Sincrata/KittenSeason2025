${PregnantName} fiddled with the sugar packet on the table, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart doing a little flutter-kick ${PregnantSheHeThey} hadn't quite felt before. Across from ${PregnantHerHimThem}, ${OtherName} grinned, oblivious, as ${OtherSheHeThey} recounted a funny story from ${OtherHerHisTheir} work day. They were at their favorite cozy cafe, sunlight streaming through the window, but ${PregnantName} felt a different kind of warmth – a mix of apprehension and bubbling hope. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} knew this was the moment. Taking a deep breath, ${PregnantName} interrupted ${OtherHerHisTheir} tale. "${OtherName}," ${PregnantSheHeThey} began, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice softer than usual. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} paused, sensing the shift in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} tone. "I... I have something to tell you. Something big." ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} met ${OtherHerHisTheir} gaze, a shy smile gracing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} lips. "I found out I'm pregnant. With our kitten."A moment of silence hung in the air, then ${OtherName}'s eyes widened.

Question:
How does ${OtherName} respond? Happy or Nervous?

"${PregnantName}, that's... that's incredible! Oh my goodness, a baby! Our baby!" ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} was beaming, ${OtherHerHisTheir} excitement infectious. "Are you serious? This is the best news I've ever heard!" ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} grip tightened gently, ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes sparkling with unshed tears of happiness. "We're going to be parents!"
${PregnantName}'s own worries dissolved seeing ${OtherHerHisTheir} joyous reaction. "Yes," ${PregnantSheHeThey} confirmed, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} smile mirroring ${OtherHersHisTheirs}. "We are." ${OtherName} squeezed ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hands, ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes full of love for ${PregnantHerHimThem} and the life growing within ${PregnantHerHimThem}. "I can't wait," ${OtherSheHeThey} said, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice thick with emotion. They sat there, hands clasped, already imagining their future, a beautiful new chapter unfolding right before their eyes. Their love, already strong, deepened with the promise of their little one, a testament to the incredible journey they were about to embark on together.`; // your happy story here

      text = `${OtherName}'s world tilted. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} initial reaction was a surge of pure, unadulterated panic. A baby? Now? ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} loved ${PregnantName} more than anything, and deep down, the idea of having a child with ${PregnantHerHimThem} was a dream ${OtherSheHeThey} secretly harbored. But the practicalities hit ${OtherHerHimThem} like a tidal wave – money, responsibilities, their still-developing careers. Could they even afford a kitten? ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} mind raced, a knot forming in ${OtherHerHisTheir} stomach.
${PregnantName} must have seen the fear in ${OtherHerHisTheir} eyes. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} reached across the table, taking ${OtherHerHisTheir} hand. "I know it’s a lot, ${OtherName}. I'm scared too." 
They talked for what felt like hours, discussing their worries, their hopes, and the sheer daunting nature of it all. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} openly admitted ${OtherHerHisTheir} financial anxieties, and ${PregnantSheHeThey} acknowledged them, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} understanding gaze unwavering.
Slowly, as they spoke, the initial panic in ${OtherName} began to subside, replaced by a quiet determination. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} looked at ${PregnantName}, at ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hopeful, slightly fragile smile, and knew what ${OtherSheHeThey} wanted. "We'll figure it out, won't we?" ${OtherSheHeThey} said, squeezing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand reassuringly. "It won't be easy, but we'll take it one step at a time. Together." ${PregnantName}'s smile widened, and for the first time that night, a genuine sense of peace settled between them.`; // your nervous story here

      page = "d";
      text = `${OtherName}'s eyes widened, ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} jaw slacked. "Pregnant? Are you serious?" ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} managed, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice barely a whisper. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} mind reeled. "Are you... are you sure it's mine?" The words tumbled out before ${OtherSheHeThey} could truly process them, a desperate search for solid ground in a suddenly shifting world. ${PregnantName}’s eyes flashed with anger, the warmth draining from ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face. "${OtherName}!" ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} exclaimed, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice sharp with hurt.

"No, no, I'm so sorry! That was stupid, I didn't mean it like that," ${OtherSheHeThey} stammered, immediately regretting ${OtherHerHisTheir} impulsive question. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} truly wasn't against the idea of a kitten, not entirely, but the news had hit ${OtherHerHimThem} like a tidal wave, leaving ${OtherHerHimThem} gasping for air. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} thoughts were a tangled mess of fear and an overwhelming sense of unpreparedness. They finished their date in a haze of unspoken worries, their usual lightness replaced by a heavy, uncertain silence.

Later that night, the weight of the day settled on ${OtherName}. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} picked up ${OtherHerHisTheir} phone, ${OtherHerHisTheir} finger hovering over ${PregnantName}’s contact. Taking a deep breath, ${OtherSheHeThey} dialled. "${PregnantName}, I am so incredibly sorry for how I reacted earlier," ${OtherSheHeThey} began, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice earnest. "I was shocked, and I said something really foolish. I'm scared, yes, but I promise, we’ll figure this out. Together." A small, hopeful silence met ${OtherHerHisTheir} words, a fragile bridge built between them.`; // your shock story here
