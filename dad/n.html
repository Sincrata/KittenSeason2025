  // ✅ Step 1: Insert your main prompt text here between the ``
  const storyText = `For months, the world of ${OtherName} had revolved around one glorious, life-changing event: the arrival of ${OtherHerHisTheir} little one. Every nursery rhyme sung, every tiny onesie folded, every childbirth class attended felt like a step closer to a perfectly orchestrated welcome. Photos and updates from the surrogate were coming in on the regular. Now well into her third trimester, she carried ${OtherHerHisTheir} precious cargo with an impressive grace that belied her considerable size. ${OtherName} had meticulously prepared for every scenario, or so ${OtherSheHeThey} thought. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere}, in ${OtherHerHisTheir} mind, totally ready.
The excitement was palpable, anticipation manifesting through late-night kitten name debates and joyful nursery decorating sessions. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)}’d spent countless hours deciding on everything from feeding schedules to first words, convinced ${OtherSheHeThey} had every base covered. The hospital bag had been packed and repacked, a symbol of ${OtherHerHisTheir} readiness, sitting patiently by the door. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} a textbook example of a prepared parent-to-be, brimming with confidence that when the moment came, ${OtherSheHeThey} would handle it with calm competence.
Then, at 2:37 AM, the universe decided to test ${OtherHerHisTheir} theory.
${OtherName} awoke to a sudden, blaring ringtone that tore through the peaceful quiet of ${OtherHerHisTheir} bedroom. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} immediately recognized the chime as the one specifically set to ${OtherHerHisTheir} surrogate’s number. It instantly jolted ${OtherName} awake. ${OtherName} picked up the phone and fumbled it in ${OtherHerHisTheir} hands before picking it up. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} eyes widened at once. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} voice laced with surprise and a touch of fear. "It's… it's time!?"
In that instant, every neatly filed piece of information in ${OtherName}'s brain evaporated. The calm, collected plan ${OtherSheHeThey} rehearsed a thousand times vanished into thin air, replaced by a deafening silence. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} mind, usually a well-oiled machine, went completely blank. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} stared at the phone, illuminated by the soft glow of the digital clock, ${OtherHerHisTheir} face contorted in an expression of stunned shock as they listened to the surrogate on the line. Panic, cold and swift, began to coil in ${OtherHerHisTheir} stomach.
${OtherName} finished the call but even basic speech seemed to scatter like dust in the wind. A wave of unexpected panic washed over. She was in so much pain. ${OtherName} was trying to listen but all ${OtherSheHeThey} retained was the surrogate's quick breathing and groans of pain.
How ${OtherDoesDo} ${OtherSheHeThey} handle this? Get a hold of ${OtherHerHimThem}self or Freak out

      response: `Heroes aren’t born in calm waters; they’re forged in moments of crisis. After what felt like an eternity, but was probably only a few frantic seconds, ${OtherName}’s primal instincts kicked in. The fog lifted. “Okay, okay, focus, ${OtherName},” ${OtherSheHeThey} said to ${OtherHerHimThem}self, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice surprisingly steady despite the tremor in ${OtherHerHisTheir} hands. The pre-packed “go-bag,” which had sat innocently by the door for weeks, was snatched up. Keys jingled as ${OtherSheHeThey} grabbed them from the hook.

${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} rushed to the car and drove the short trip to the surrogate’s home. When ${OtherSheHeThey} arrived ${OtherSheHeThey} used a spare key she had given ${OtherHerHimThem} to come in and found her on the floor of her bedroom slowly making her way out. 

“I got you!” ${OtherName} quickly ran to her side to help her up carefully.

 “Come on, slow and steady,” ${OtherSheHeThey} urged, gently helping her to her feet, ${OtherName}’s eyes scanning the surrogate’s face for any sign of worsening pain. The fear hadn't vanished, but it was now channeled into action.

The short, frantic journey to the car felt like a scene from an action movie, albeit one featuring a very pregnant woman and a slightly dazed parent-to-be. 
${OtherName} carefully helped her into the back seat, buckled her in, and practically leaped into the driver's seat.
 
 ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} put the car in reverse, ${OtherHerHisTheir} heart pounding a frantic rhythm against ${OtherHerHisTheir} ribs. As ${OtherSheHeThey} pulled out of the driveway and onto the quiet street, a strange thing happened. The harsh, gripping pain that had awakened the surrogate, the pain that had sent ${OtherHerHimThem} into a dizzying spiral of panic, began to subside. ${OtherName} took a few deeper breaths along with her, and she felt her muscles relax, and surprisingly, the contractions simply… stopped. “${OtherName}, ” she said, her voice softer now, tinged with confusion. “I… I feel a lot better. No more pain.”
Despite the newfound calm in the car, ${OtherName} wasn’t taking any chances. “We’re still going,” ${OtherSheHeThey} declared, ${OtherHerHisTheir} grip on the steering wheel firm. “Better safe than sorry,” ${OtherName} said. The hospital emergency room was quiet at that hour. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} ${OtherWasWere} quickly seen by a kind, reassuring doctor, who listened patiently to ${OtherHerHisTheir} breathless account of the midnight drama. The doctor performed a quick check-up, a gentle smile playing on their lips. “Well, dear,” the doctor announced, their voice calm and comforting, “it seems your kitten isn’t quite ready to make their grand entrance just yet. It appears you’ve had what we call ‘Braxton Hicks’ contractions, or a ‘false alarm.’ Your body is just having a little practice run for the real thing.”
${OtherName} looked at her, then back at the doctor, a wave of profound relief washing over ${OtherHerHimThem}. It was a relief so potent it felt almost like exhaustion. The adrenaline that had surged through ${OtherHerHisTheir} veins now dissipated, leaving ${OtherHerHimThem} feeling wonderfully, utterly deflated. She wasn’t in labor. It wasn't time. They could go home. As they walked back to their car under the pre-dawn glow, a sense of shared understanding settled between them. “I’m so sorry for worrying you!” The surrogate apologized, “That’s never happened to me before!” But ${OtherSheHeThey} only laughed and told her it’s okay. Life, in its infinite wisdom, had decided to give them a test run. A sneak peek into the beautiful chaos that awaited them. All those confident pronouncements about being "totally ready" now seemed… well, a little naive. ${OtherName} realized that while ${OtherSheHeThey}’d thought ${OtherSheHeThey} ${OtherWasWere} prepared, the sheer, primal shock of the moment had temporarily derailed ${OtherHerHimThem}. ${OtherName} learned that even the most well-practiced techniques could vanish under pressure.

      response: `The next few minutes dissolved into a chaotic, almost comical, blur. The initial shock didn’t dissipate; it solidified, trapping ${OtherHerHimThem} in a vortex of frenzied panic. "Where are the bags?!" ${OtherName} bellowed, tripping over a laundry basket. "The hospital bag! The snacks! My phone!" ${OtherName} shrieked, ${OtherHerHisTheir} voice startlingly loud in the pre-dawn quiet, as ${OtherSheHeThey} fumbled with ${OtherHerHisTheir} jeans. ${cap(OtherHerHisTheir)} shouts, a desperate attempt to cut through the fog of their ${OtherHerHisTheir} alarm and actually accomplish something. It was as if ${OtherSheHeThey} needed to shout just to keep moving, to break the spell of paralysis that threatened to consume ${OtherHerHimThem}. The perfectly constructed facade of readiness, built patiently over nine months, crumbled into dust around ${OtherHerHisTheir} ears.
In ${OtherHerHisTheir} haste, every movement seemed designed to go wrong. ${OtherName} stumbled out of the bedroom, one foot bare, the other sporting a single slipper. ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} snatched car keys from the hook, only to discover, mere seconds later, they were the keys to ${OtherHerHisTheir} old, defunct bicycle. ${OtherName}, managing to pull on a top backwards, finally made it to the doorway, clutching a bag that, upon closer inspection, turned out to be filled with clean laundry instead of essential kitten items. Yet, through all the bumbling and shouting, ${OtherSheHeThey} somehow, miraculously, made it to the car. ${OtherName} wrestled with the car seat base, grunting with effort, before finally remembering it was already installed.

${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} started driving towards the hospital before quickly realizing ${OtherSheHeThey} forgot the surrogate!! ${cap(OtherSheHeThey)} pulled an emergency u-turn to head to her house! When ${OtherSheHeThey} arrived they used a spare key she had given ${OtherHerHimThem} to come in and found her on the floor of her bedroom slowly making her way out. 

“I got you!” ${OtherName} quickly ran to her side to help her up carefully.

But as ${OtherSheHeThey} drove her home in the dawn light, the city slowly stirring to life around them, a new perspective began to form. Yes, ${OtherSheHeThey} had shouted, ${OtherSheHeThey} had fumbled, ${OtherSheHeThey} had made every comical mistake imaginable. Yet, despite the theatrical chaos and the complete meltdown of ${OtherHerHisTheir} composure, ${OtherSheHeThey} had gotten the surrogate to the hospital. And that, in itself, was something. Perhaps this unexpected trial was exactly what ${OtherSheHeThey} needed. It was a humbling, hilarious lesson that shattered ${OtherHerHisTheir} delusions of perfection. Maybe, just maybe, by letting go of ${OtherHerHisTheir} rigid ideas of how labor "should" unfold and accepting the beautiful, unpredictable messiness of it all,  ${OtherSheHeThey} would find a deeper, more genuine sense of readiness when the true "go time" finally arrived. And that,  ${OtherSheHeThey} realized, might be the most valuable preparation of all.
