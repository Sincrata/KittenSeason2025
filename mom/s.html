  const storyText = `For ${PregnantName}, the world had never felt so full of anticipation. In ${PregnantHerHisTheir} third trimester, with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} kittenfloss all but ready to make their grand debut, ${PregnantSheHeThey} was a whirlwind of careful planning and bubbling excitement. Every nursery item was meticulously placed, every tiny outfit folded, and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} heart swelled with the thought of finally holding ${PregnantHerHisTheir} kitten. As a single parent-to-be, ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantHasHave} embraced this journey with fierce independence and unwavering love, preparing not just a home, but a vibrant new chapter for ${PregnantHerHimThem}self and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} little one. And finally, the day had arrived – ${PregnantHerHisTheir} very last day of work before parental leave!

Walking through ${PregnantHerHisTheir} front door, a wave of relief washed over ${PregnantHerHimThem}, mingled with the joyful flutter of what lay ahead. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} was ready to celebrate this milestone, perhaps with a quiet evening to ${PregnantHerHimThem}self, but fate (and ${PregnantHerHisTheir} wonderful friends) had other plans. Just as ${PregnantSheHeThey} was settling in, a friendly honk from outside signaled an unexpected rendezvous. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} friend was waiting, whisking ${PregnantHerHimThem} away to what ${PregnantName} vaguely knew was a dinner outing. As ${PregnantSheHeThey} waddled, round and radiant, into the bustling restaurant, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} belly a beautiful mountain of life, a chorus of cheers erupted. Balloons adorned ${PregnantHerHisTheir} chair, a cake sat proudly on the table, and several brightly wrapped presents, adorned with cutesy baby motifs, beckoned from nearby bags. It was practically a surprise baby shower, and ${PregnantName}, overwhelmed by the sheer love and thoughtfulness, felt tears welling in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} eyes.

The evening was a beautiful blur of laughter, heartfelt advice, and the comforting presence of friends who truly cared. ${PregnantName} felt utterly cherished, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} spirit soaring with renewed excitement for the adventure ahead. Returning home later, laden with thoughtful gifts and a heart brimming with gratitude, ${PregnantSheHeThey} felt more ready than ever. The following week, however, proved to be an exercise in patience. Time stretched, each hour feeling like an eternity. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} cleaned every nook and cranny of the house, rearranged the nursery for the tenth time, and tried to relax – a monumental task when every cell in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} body hummed with readiness. 

${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} reliable friend was on standby, ready to spring into action at a moment’s notice, but for now, it was just ${PregnantName}, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} nesting instincts, and an ever-present conversation with ${PregnantHerHisTheir} unborn child. "Come whenever you're ready, little one," ${PregnantSheHeThey}'d whisper to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} belly in bed, "I can't wait to meet you."

Then came the due date, a date that arrived and, to ${PregnantName}’s growing nervousness, simply passed by. A quick call to ${PregnantHerHisTheir} doctor reassured ${PregnantHerHimThem}: due dates were merely estimates, a kitten’s grand entrance was always on their own unique schedule. Several days passed and ${PregnantName} sought solace in a warm bath, scooping bubbly water over ${PregnantHerHisTheir} magnificent belly, a soothing ritual amidst the quiet anxiety. "It's okay," ${PregnantSheHeThey} mused, letting the warmth envelop ${PregnantHerHimThem}, "There’s no need to rush. You can take all the time you need, my sweet." It was as if ${PregnantHerHisTheir} baby, hearing this gentle resignation, chose that very moment to make their presence known. A sharp, undeniable contraction seized ${PregnantHerHimThem}.

Overjoyed and simultaneously in an incredible surge of pain, ${PregnantName} let the first wave pass. With careful, deliberate movements, ${PregnantSheHeThey} eased ${PregnantHerHimThem}self out of the tub, nearly slipping in ${PregnantHerHisTheir} haste. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} hand instinctively reached for ${PregnantHerHisTheir} phone, dialing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} friend as ${PregnantSheHeThey} fumbled with a towel, trying to dry ${PregnantHerHimThem}self off. Just as ${PregnantSheHeThey} gathered ${PregnantHerHimThem} damp hair into a towel, another, stronger contraction hit ${PregnantHerHimThem}. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} couldn’t believe it! 

Now, when ${PregnantSheHeThey} ${PregnantWasWere} least prepared, soaking wet and undressed, the baby decided it was time! Gritting ${PregnantHerHisTheir} teeth, ${PregnantSheHeThey} fought through the intensity, pulling on a soft nightgown and grabbing ${PregnantHerHisTheir} already packed hospital bag. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} was almost at the door when yet another contraction locked ${PregnantHerHimThem} in place. "Okay, okay," ${PregnantSheHeThey} breathed, bracing ${PregnantHerHimThem}self, "The kitten wants me to go slow, and slow I shall go."

${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} friend finally arrived, finding ${PregnantName} remarkably calm, perched on the edge of the couch, breathing in measured, rhythmic breaths as ${PregnantHerHisTheir} hand gently stroked ${PregnantHerHisTheir} damp belly. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} friend, unaware of the electric excitement buzzing beneath ${PregnantName}’s serene exterior, helped ${PregnantHerHimThem} into the car. The journey to the hospital was surprisingly smooth; it was mid-day on a lazy Tuesday, so traffic was light. They were seen immediately by the efficient hospital staff, and ${PregnantName} was soon settled into a quiet room, ready to embrace the long hours of labor. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} baby, however, continued to take their time, keeping ${PregnantHerHimThem} waiting for what felt like an eternity. The wait was agonizing, each passing minute drawing out ${PregnantHerHisTheir} anticipation.

Finally, as twilight painted the sky outside, the doctor’s encouraging words cut through the exhaustion: "It's time to push, ${PregnantName}!" ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} patience, already stretched thin, evaporated into a surge of adrenaline. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} couldn't wait another second to meet ${PregnantHerHisTheir} precious child. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} tried to hurry, to urge ${PregnantHerHisTheir} baby along, but even the final act of birth seemed to drag. This baby, ${PregnantSheHeThey} thought with a weary smile, was truly comfortable in there. 

Then, it was done, with one final push, a beautiful, piercing cry filled the room. ${PregnantName} didn’t have to wait a moment longer. ${cap(PregnantHerHisTheir)} precious baby, quickly swaddled in a soft blanket, was gently placed into ${PregnantHerHisTheir} waiting arms. Tears streamed down ${PregnantHerHisTheir} face, a mix of pure relief, overwhelming love, and profound joy. ${cap(PregnantSheHeThey)} leaned down, giving ${PregnantHerHisTheir} baby a tender kiss on ${PregnantHerHisTheir} tiny forehead. “It was worth every single second of the wait, my love,” ${PregnantSheHeThey} whispered, ${PregnantHerHisTheir} voice thick with emotion, as ${PregnantHerHisTheir} new life, a single parent’s beautiful dream, truly began.
